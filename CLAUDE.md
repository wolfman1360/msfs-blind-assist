# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in this repository, kept small on purpose: each area's rules load on their own when you read that area's code, and their full text lives in `docs/invariants/`. See "Where things live" and "Adding or changing a rule" below.

## Project Overview

MSFS Blind Assist - C# Windows Forms accessibility application for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Multi-aircraft support (FlyByWire A320, Fenix A320, iniBuilds A300 and more, extensible). SimConnect integration, screen reader optimized (NVDA/JAWS). .NET 10, Windows Forms, SQLite.

## Build

```bash
dotnet build MSFSBlindAssist.sln -c Debug
dotnet build MSFSBlindAssist.sln -c Release
```

The app runs from `MSFSBlindAssist\bin\x64\{Debug|Release}\net10.0-windows\`. Prerequisites: the MSFS_SDK environment variable and the .NET 10 SDK. The solution builds six projects, `tools/PMDGDispatchTester`, `tools/ChangelogBuilder` and the vPilot plugin among them; the standalone probes (`tools/CDUTest`, `IFlySdkProbe`, `StandBridgeSweep`, `LandingExitSweep`) build on their own. Output paths, the projects and the probes in full: [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#build-output-and-traps).

- [CORE-1] Always build the `.sln` or pass `-p:Platform=x64`; never the bare `.csproj`, which defaults to AnyCPU and writes to `bin\Debug\…`, so the x64 exe the app runs from never updates. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-1
- [CORE-2] `-r win-x64` (or `dotnet publish -r win-x64`) writes a separate `net10.0-windows\win-x64\` tree a plain build never touches: build to, and check the timestamp in, the folder the app launches from. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-2
- [CORE-3] The exe is file-locked while MSFSBA runs (MSB3021): close the app before building an exe the user will run. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-3
- [CORE-4] `tools/CDUTest` and the other standalone probes (`IFlySdkProbe`, `StandBridgeSweep`, `LandingExitSweep`) build on their own, never as part of the solution. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-4

## Testing

Pure-logic code is covered by an xUnit characterization suite at `tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests`
(run: `dotnet test tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests.csproj -c Debug -p:Platform=x64`).
CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs it on every PR and on pushes to main.
Sim-facing behavior cannot be unit-tested: when changing SimConnect/UI paths, build, then
describe an in-sim test plan in the PR — the human owner of the repo runs it. New pure logic
(formatters, parsers, geometry, classifiers) should get characterization tests; don't add
speculative tests for sim-driven paths.

- [CORE-5] Sim-facing paths are verified only in a live sim: a PR touching them describes an in-sim test plan. Pure logic gets characterization tests in `tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests` (CI-enforced). Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-5

## Before changing behaviour

**Check before calling it an oversight.** Before changing how something BEHAVES (wording,
rounding, what a control shows, a checklist step, a default), rather than fixing a clear defect,
read the aircraft's rule files (`.claude/rules/`) and its own doc: many differences between aircraft
are deliberate and pinned there ("never harmonize"). Then compare:

- For how an aircraft SYSTEM behaves, compare only against another add-on of the same type: the
  FBW A32NX against the Fenix, the PMDG 737 against the iFly 737. Different types differ by
  design, even from the same maker (a 787 is not a 737, an A380 is not an A320), so a difference
  there is not an oversight.
- For how the APP presents things (whether a window shows a control's state, wording, number
  formatting), compare across all aircraft.

If the comparison shows this aircraft is the odd one out, fix it and say in the PR which aircraft
you compared against. If not, it is a design choice: write the PR as a proposal the reviewer can
adjust or drop. Worked example: #264. The FBW A320 and A380 autopilot windows showed a fixed
"Autothrust engage" button, while every other button in those windows, and the autothrottle
buttons of the HS787, iFly 737 and MD-11 windows, showed state. That is a presentation question,
so comparing across types was valid. The Fenix window shows state on none of its buttons, so it
was left alone.

**Fix the aircraft the request is about.** If the same problem shows up on another aircraft, fix
it in the same PR only when the code is shared (#264: the A320 and A380 read the same
`A32NX_AUTOTHRUST_STATUS` through one helper). When the other aircraft keeps its own code, name it
in the PR as "also seen on …" and leave it for its own issue or PR, so it gets its own in-sim test
and review. The other aircraft shows what is missing; it is not a template for the fix. Build each
aircraft's fix from its own variables and behaviour.

**Check the whole of what you touched.** For a display, check the whole page, not only the broken
line (#259 fixed one MCDU line and pushed the others off the 24-column grid, fixed in #262). For
shared code, check every aircraft that uses it, including those that override it (#260's shared
trim debounce also had to hold on the PMDG 777's override). For anything spoken or formatted, add a
test that sets a comma-decimal culture (de-DE or sv-SE): CI runs under en-US, so a test that does
not set one cannot catch it.

## Git workflow and release notes

The `main` branch is protected. Always create a new branch for changes and open a pull request — never commit directly to main. Every PR adds `changelog.d/<pr>-<slug>.<category>.md`, written for a pilot, not a reviewer; a required CI check fails without it. `<pr>` is READ, never guessed (issues and PRs share one number sequence): commit and push, open the PR (`gh pr create` prints its number), then add the fragment, commit and push. Categories: `aircraft`, `feature`, `improvement`, `fix`, `internal` (never published). A released fragment is never deleted; before merging, a long-running PR's own fragments may be condensed to what a pilot sees changed. Full convention: [changelog.d/README.md](changelog.d/README.md).

- [CORE-6] `main` is protected: never commit to it directly; always branch and open a PR. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-6

## Rules for any file

### Screen reader announcements

Screen readers already announce every UI control interaction, so the app NEVER announces a button press, a combo or dropdown change, or any other direct interaction in a panel. It ONLY announces numeric input confirmations, error conditions (validation failures) and background state changes the user did not trigger. Two narrow, scoped exceptions exist: the TFDi MD-11's once-after-settle press confirmation ([MD11-11]) and the EFB shell's `announceChange` opt-in ([MD11-26]). Neither is a licence to announce presses anywhere else.

- [CORE-7] NEVER announce button presses, combo/dropdown changes or any direct UI interaction in panel controls; ONLY numeric input confirmations, validation errors and background state changes. The two scoped exceptions above are the only ones. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-7
- [CORE-8] Combo double-announce suppression is GLOBAL, never aircraft-gated: `_uiSetEcho`/`MarkUiSet` plus a wrap that sets `announcer.Suppressed` around `ProcessSimVarUpdate` for any var inside the echo window. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-8
- [CORE-9] The echo-window suppression matches on TIME only, never on value: a combo set can write a different encoding than the SDK reads back, so a value compare silently misses. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-9
- [CORE-10] Never blanket-suppress value-0 resting-state button labels in MainForm; use the opt-in `SimVarDefinition.SuppressRestingButtonState` only. "LNAV: Off" and "Baro STD: QNH" are real states. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-10

### Everywhere else

- [CORE-16] Area rules (`.claude/rules/`) load only when the Read, Edit or Write tool opens a file, never through `cat`, `sed`, `rg` or Grep: Read a file before changing it, or its area's rules never reach you. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-16
- [CORE-11] In `SimConnectManager`, set `IsConnected = true` BEFORE calling `SetupDataDefinitions()`: `StartContinuousMonitoring()` guards on it. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-11
- [CORE-12] Never use `TreeView` directly in a form: use `NativeAccessibleTreeView` (the .NET UIA tree gives NVDA a wrong order); a tree with detail data populates its children lazily on `BeforeExpand`. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-12
- [CORE-13] Never hardcode the FBWBA/MSFSBlindAssist database path: reads go through `DatabasePathResolver.ResolveExistingDatabasePath`, writes through `GetCanonicalDatabasePath`. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-13
- [CORE-14] Every diagnostic log path resolves through `Utils/AppLogs.PathFor(...)` into `%APPDATA%\MSFSBlindAssist\logs`; never hand-build one. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-14
- [CORE-15] Never hand-build a log write (`File.AppendAllText`, a raw path): use `Log.Debug/Info/Warn/Error(category, msg)` for debug.log, or `Log.Channel(name)` for a named log. Full: docs/invariants/core.md#core-15
- [VAT-13] Status/diagnostic text in any settings panel is a read-only `TextBox`, never a `Label`: a `Label` is not in the tab order, so a screen-reader user has to hunt for it with the review cursor. Full: docs/invariants/vatsim.md#vat-13
- [A380C-6] Every form marshaling a background bridge push to the UI thread must wrap `BeginInvoke` in try/catch(InvalidOperationException) (`SafeBeginInvoke`); an `IsHandleCreated` check alone races handle destruction. Full: docs/invariants/a380-coherent.md#a380c-6

## Multi-Aircraft Architecture

**Core interfaces:**
- **IAircraftDefinition** - Contract for all aircraft
- **BaseAircraftDefinition** - Recommended base class (provides hotkey routing, caching, helpers)
- **FlyByWireA320Definition** - Reference implementation

**Each aircraft defines:**
- `GetVariables()` - All simulator variables
- `GetPanelStructure()` - Section/panel hierarchy
- `BuildPanelControls()` - Panel-to-variables mapping (cached automatically by base class)
- `GetHotkeyVariableMap()` - Simple hotkey action → event name mappings
- `HandleHotkeyAction()` - Custom hotkey logic (optional override)

## Quick Reference

### Adding Panel Control
1. Add to aircraft's `GetVariables()` with `UpdateFrequency.OnRequest`
2. Add variable key to `BuildPanelControls()` under appropriate panel
3. Test - automatic registration and UI generation

### Adding Background Monitoring
1. Add to `GetVariables()` with `UpdateFrequency.Continuous` + `IsAnnounced = true`
2. Do NOT add to `BuildPanelControls()` - batched monitoring is automatic (sole exception: the var is itself a panel control's read-back — see [VAR-6] in `.claude/rules/variable-definitions.md`)
3. Change detection and announcements are automatic (supports 1000 variables)
4. A var that `ProcessSimVarUpdate` consumes SILENTLY (a cache for hotkey readouts or dialog fields, never spoken) must ALSO set `ExcludeFromMonitorManager = true` (HS787: add it to `CacheOnlyVariables`) - otherwise it earns a Ctrl+M checkbox that mutes nothing

### Adding New Aircraft
1. Create class inheriting `BaseAircraftDefinition`
2. Override: `GetVariables()`, `GetPanelStructure()`, `BuildPanelControls()`
3. Add menu item in `MainForm.Designer.cs` + click handler
4. Add to `LoadAircraftFromCode()` switch statement
5. Use `FlyByWireA320Definition.cs` as template

### Variable Types
- **K:EVENT** - Standard MSFS events (via SimConnect TransmitClientEvent)
- **L:VARIABLE** - Local variables (reading aircraft state)
- **H:EVENT** - Hardware events (via MobiFlight WASM module)
- **PMDGVar** - PMDG SDK variables (read via Client Data Area broadcast)

### `SimConnectManager.SetLVar` — GLOBAL MobiFlight calc-path routing (2026-06)

Every L:var write is routed through the MobiFlight calculator path when connected (gated on `CalcPathVerified`), never the native data-def write. Full routing rules, the H:/dotted event queue, and the RPN invariant-formatting rule: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Adding or changing a rule

A rule is a guardrail a future change could break: a "never", a "must", a measured trap. Write it as ONE line, at most 400 characters, in the rule file of the code it guards:

`- [PREFIX-n] <the rule, naming the key type or method> Full: docs/invariants/<stem>.md#<prefix-n>`

Take the next unused number for that prefix; IDs are never renumbered or reused, so code comments and commit messages can cite them. The explanation, measurements and history go under `## PREFIX-n` in `docs/invariants/<stem>.md`. A new aircraft or subsystem gets its own rule file, with `paths:` globs for its code and its tests, and its own full-text file, plus a row above; until it has a rule, its rule file is a heading and one line naming its doc. Before writing the line, Read the file that DECLARES what it guards (for a partial class, the partial holding that member) and confirm one of the rule file's globs matches it: `TaxiGuidanceManager`, `TaxiGraph` and `MainForm` are split into partials by mechanism, not by area, and no test can check this for you. When a rule's code lives in or is called from another area's files, MIRROR its line word for word into a rule file scoped to those files (`mainform-call-sites.md`, `taxi-call-sites.md`, `settings-call-sites.md`, or a "Mirrored from …" block in an area file that already loads them). CLAUDE.md takes only rules that apply to ANY file in the repository (two area rules are mirrored here for that reason). To change a rule, edit its line, every mirror and its full text together. To retire one, delete its lines and rename its heading `## PREFIX-n (retired: <why>)` so the number is never taken again. `ClaudeContextBudgetTests` (CI) enforces the limits, fails when a file in an aircraft's own folders or a Coherent agent script loads no rule file, or when code loads none while its test does, or when CLAUDE.md gains a section or a doc link outside its map, and says what to do when one is hit. An older code comment that cites CLAUDE.md for a rule ("see the CLAUDE.md flyPad note") means text that now lives in `docs/invariants/`: search there for the rule's key name.
