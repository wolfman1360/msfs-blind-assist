> A screen reader accessible Windows application allowing totally blind flight simulation enthusiasts to control and fly aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator with a keyboard and their choice of peripherals.

## About

This application uses Windows standard controls, screen reader announcements and global hotkeys to give full control of supported aircraft in MSFS2020 and MSFS2024 to people who are blind or visually impaired.

## Download

- **Stable release:** [Download MSFSBA.zip (latest release)](https://github.com/oasis1701/msfs-blind-assist/releases/latest/download/MSFSBA.zip). The release notes are on the [latest release page](https://github.com/oasis1701/msfs-blind-assist/releases/latest), and older versions on the [Releases page](https://github.com/oasis1701/msfs-blind-assist/releases).
- **Preview build:** [Download MSFSBA-preview.zip (rolling preview)](https://github.com/oasis1701/msfs-blind-assist/releases/download/preview/MSFSBA-preview.zip). The preview is rebuilt every time a change lands on `main`, so it has the newest work, reviewed and tested, but with far less flying time than a release: bugs and stability problems are more likely. Everything it contains since the last release is listed on the [preview release page](https://github.com/oasis1701/msfs-blind-assist/releases/tag/preview).

Both builds come as a zip. Extract it to a folder of your choice and run `MSFSBlindAssist.exe`. To update by hand, close MSFS Blind Assist and extract the new zip over the same folder.

MSFS Blind Assist needs the **.NET 10 Desktop Runtime (x64)** from the [.NET 10 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0). If it is missing, the app says so when you start it and points you to the download.

Once installed, the app checks GitHub for updates at startup and installs them for you. It offers release builds by default; switch to the preview channel under **Settings → Updates** to be offered previews as well. See [Updates and release channels](docs/updates.md) for the details, including how to go back from a preview to a release.

## Features
- Panels for supported aircraft that allow blind users to use their keyboard to scroll through switches, knobs, and similar controls and interact with them.
- Global hotkeys for accessing a comprehensive set of features, such as on-demand readout of heading/speed/altitude/VS and many more
- Continuous monitoring of aircraft systems and announcing changes, for example, Master Warning and Master Caution alerts and many more.
- Turn-by-turn taxi guidance with a stereo-panned audio steering tone ("taxiway localizer") and spoken announcements for turns, taxiway crossings, hold-shorts and arrivals. Enter your ATC clearance and the app routes you through the exact taxiways — works on any airport the user's database covers, not just major hubs.
- Real-world taxiway and gate names, filled in automatically. Where your scenery's database leaves taxiways unnamed or uses different names/gate numbers than ATC, the app quietly adds the real names from OpenStreetMap and the X-Plane Scenery Gateway (your database always stays authoritative). Differing names appear as their own labeled dropdown entries — e.g. pick "B (HAWKER)" or "Gate 131 (GH 5)" — so you can enter exactly what ATC says. Can be toggled off in Taxi Guidance Options.
- Accessible GSX Ground Services Pro window with screen-reader-readable menu, tooltip, service progress, invoices/receipts, and GSX settings access.
- Capability to teleport to and from gates to runways, still available for users who prefer it or for quick repositioning.
- Additional tools to assist visually impaired pilots to fly, for example, take-off assistance which announces when the pilot is deviating from the runway, as well as pitch monitoring.
- Touchdown feedback on every aircraft: read your last landing rate (touchdown vertical speed) and the peak g-force of the landing with a hotkey.
- Aircraft-specific dedicated systems. On the FlyByWire A32NX for example, blind users can hear and read all engine and display warning messages, read fuel and payload and weight/balance details in full, hear Flight Mode Annunciator messages, get on-demand information on next waypoint, etc.
- An extensive text-based location and map viewer. Configurable with filters, lets users read direction and distance to major and small cities, landmarks, terrain and water bodies while they fly!
- A full-featured flight plan route viewer that supports SID, STAR and approach procedures, with waypoint tracking during flight.
- Airport and runway lookup
- Much more

## Requirements

Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) with the **.NET 10 Desktop Runtime (x64)**; see [Download](#download).

### MobiFlight WASM module

To operate cockpit switches and knobs on the **FlyByWire (A32NX and A380X)** and **Fenix A320** aircraft, MSFS Blind Assist needs the free **MobiFlight WASM module** installed. The app uses it to reliably set the aircraft's internal variables; without it, many controls on these aircraft will not respond (reading and announcements still work). PMDG and HorizonSim aircraft do not require it.

Download it from the [MobiFlight WASM module download page](https://mobiflight.com/download/thank-you), then place the module in your MSFS Community folder (the same place your add-on aircraft live) and restart the simulator.

## Supported Aircraft

- Honours the A380's own units in MSFSBA's read-outs: **metric altitude** (FCU MTRS — every altitude reads, and the FCU altitude input is entered, in metres) and **kg/lb weight**; the clock chronometer and elapsed-time counter; pitch/rudder trim; fuel pumps; and the audio control panel.
- All our shared features are integrated as well, including taxi guidance, the landing exit planner, route viewer, gate/runway teleport, METAR report, location info and text-based map.
- A complete screen-reader-first manual ships in the `Guides` folder (`Guides/a380-manual.html`).

## VATSIM (vPilot)

MSFS Blind Assist can announce VATSIM network activity reported by [vPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/) through your screen reader: connections and disconnections, private messages, radio chatter on the frequencies you're tuned to, and SELCAL alerts.

It's off by default. Turn it on from **Settings → VATSIM**: tick the master switch and press OK, and MSFS Blind Assist finds your vPilot installation and installs the plugin for you — you just need to restart vPilot afterwards so it picks the plugin up. Mute announcements for the rest of a flight at any time with **Output mode > Alt+V**, without opening Settings.

If you used the older standalone `vPilot-to-TTS` tray application, its vPilot plugin is removed automatically the first time this feature installs its own — you only need to uninstall the old tray application yourself.

## FAQ

### How can people use computers if they can't see anything?

Blind and visually impaired users can use screen reading software to navigate and interact with computers, as well as phones and tablets.
For more information, please see:
https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/introduction-screen-readers

###  What's the point of using a flight simulation software to fly if user can't see the screen properly?

This is a common question and a curiosity within the aviation community and other industries that are less accessible and exposed to people with disabilities. While I can't speak for every individual, it's worth noting that users with disabilities should not only have access to essential services and infrastructure, but also be supported in hobbies they enjoy, enabling them to engage with topics they're interested in and socialize within those communities.
In our case, a person who is totally blind or lacks the vision to interact with a simulated aircraft might enjoy a lot of the aspects of the simulation, such as:
- Executing real-life procedures to their capability
- Learning all the theories and studying documentation and subjects regarding aviation
- Flying alongside sighted users, joining communities, and conversing in the same space on the subject that they enjoy
- Using AI to describe scenery while they fly
- Collecting and logging virtual flights, just like sighted users
- and more
