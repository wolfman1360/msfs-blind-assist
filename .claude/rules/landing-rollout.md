# Landing rollout guidance rules

Loaded when Claude reads matching code. Background: docs/taxi-guidance.md. Full text of each rule: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md.

- [ROL-1] The landing assist hands its rollout tone to taxi guidance SILENTLY (`LandingFlareAssistManager.StepTaxiHandover`), never by widening `IsLandingExitTaxiSteering` to backtracking; its own end is QUEUED when taxi guidance ran, so it never clips a taxi sentence. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-1
- [ROL-2] Rollout handoff to Taxiing must require `turnBegun || (atTaxiSpeed && nearExit)`; never relax `nearExit` back to speed-only, since a long runway drops below 30 kt thousands of feet before the exit. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-2
- [ROL-3] Never remove the `ROLLOUT_TURN_MAX_GS_KTS` (90 kt) cap on `turnBegun`: above 90 kt a heading deviation is touchdown yaw or crosswind crab, not a real exit turn. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-3
- [ROL-4] `EnterRunwayEndCountdown` must null `_route`/`_destinationNodeId` on overshoot-with-no-exit, or `TryRecalculateRoute` routes back across the runway to the already-passed exit. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-4
- [ROL-5] Measure the overshoot "downfield" cutoff from the aircraft as well as the missed exit (`RolloutExitGate.DownfieldCutoffFeet`); the aircraft is a FLOOR, never an extra margin stacked on the exit-relative value. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-5
- [ROL-6] Every path that lands in `Taxiing` with a null `_route` must STOP the steering tone first (`UpdatePosition` early-returns, so a tone holds its last pan forever) and say what happened. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-6
- [ROL-7] A go-around or touch-and-go ENDS landing-exit guidance and keeps the plan (`LandingExitGoAround`): held only while KNOWN airborne, decided after `ConfirmMs` by a FRESH position read (never the 1 Hz cache), then ONE sentence. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-7
- [ROL-8] `TryEarlyExitHandoff` must fire ONLY for High-speed exits (angle <50°); never restore it for Normal/End exits, where it hard-panned the tone 300 ft early with no verbal cue. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-8
- [ROL-9] Every handoff to Taxiing must re-route from the live aircraft position via the extension-node logic; never revert to the ApronNodeId-only re-route (Normal/End exits have ApronNodeId==NodeId). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-9
- [ROL-10] The post-high-speed-exit `ExitBearingTrue` pan floor has exactly TWO releases: the opposite-sign test on the pavement and lateral clearance (`IsWithinRolloutRunwayLaterally`); never magnitude-vs-floor, never the unconditional `Math.Max/Min` clamp. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-10
- [ROL-11] The implicit-exit shallow-angle override needs BOTH guards together (apron forward-direction AND `apronAngle > currentAngleFwd`); dropping either regresses the exit bearing. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-11
- [ROL-12] The `exitedLaterally` handoff trigger must use the combined gate (lateral + dist/hdgDelta/pastExit), never bare lateral distance, which fires before the tone's exit-bearing phase engages. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-12
- [ROL-13] The passive-handoff `exitedLaterallyPH` check must NOT be gated like the trigger: different semantics, and gating it delays clearing the overshoot monitor. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-13
- [ROL-14] `_rolloutRunway` must stay cached through `EnterRunwayEndCountdown`: the countdown needs it, and full silence on a missed last exit is unsafe for a blind pilot. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-14
- [ROL-15] `BeginLandingRolloutNoGraph` must defensively null `_route` at entry regardless of the takeoff path, so the handoff-failure fallback invariant always holds. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-15
- [ROL-16] `RetargetLandingExit` must cascade through every downfield exit before giving up; an Earlier retarget's fall-forward stops SILENTLY at the exit already targeted (`RetargetCallout.StaysOnPlannedExit`), and an exit that fails to route is skipped by the undershoot scan. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-16
- [ROL-17] The undershoot retarget scan needs a speed-proportional minimum lead distance, never "nearest within 1000 ft", which retargets to an exit impossible to make at the aircraft's speed. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-17
- [ROL-18] Rollout announce latches (e.g. `_rolloutApproach900Announced`) must be reset at all four sites: `BeginLandingRollout`, `BeginLandingRolloutNoGraph`, `EnterRunwayEndCountdown`, `StopGuidance`. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-18
- [ROL-19] Derived-constant tripwire: re-derive all five (`VacatedShortAlongTrackFeet`, `EarlyVacateMaxPassedFeet`, `HandoffReachDefaultHalfWidthM`, `RunwayClearMarginM`, `DefaultRunwayWidthFeet`; three hang on `HandoffReachMarginM`) before any runway/rollout tolerance change, say so in the commit, re-run `tools/LandingExitSweep` (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-19
- [ROL-20] The rollout exit-turn gate must stay SIGNED (deviation on the exit's own side) and proximity-gated (within `RolloutExitGate.TurnWindowFeetFor`, max 1,000 ft, or past it); never the bare `Math.Abs(hdgDelta) >= 15`. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-20
- [ROL-21] The rollout tone keeps THREE modes (silent >50 kt, exit-bearing ≤300 ft, drift-correction to runway heading between), never fights a turn in the turn window, never leads to a too-fast exit, and uses `ExitBearingTrue` only if `IsPlausibleExitBearing` (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-21
- [ROL-22] Each exit has its own turn window (`RolloutExitGate.TurnWindowFeetFor`), floored at `TurnNowFeet` (150 ft), capped at 1,000 ft, computed where read from the exit targeted NOW, never cached; never go back to the fixed window (only `IsVacateAwayFromPlannedExit` keeps it). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-22
- [ROL-23] "Turn now" is never said when too fast (`RolloutExitGate.IsTooFastToTurn`): retarget downfield via `FindTooFastAlternative`, else say "too fast to turn. Slow down.", hold the runway heading, keep speed-driven handoffs closed; never say "Missed" (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-23
- [ROL-24] A retarget is ONE utterance (`RetargetCallout` via `AnnounceRetarget`): first retire every approach milestone it supersedes with the MEASURED lead of the sentence spoken (`LeadSecondsFor`), never turn-now; re-measure the lead when the wording changes, never estimate it. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-24
- [ROL-25] "Off pavement." (`PavementMap` + `OffPavementAlert`) runs only in `LandingRollout` and landing-exit `Taxiing`, only on the ground, always counts the landing runway as pavement, speaks via `AnnounceImmediate` and never names a direction (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-25
- [ROL-26] After an early vacate never re-route to the PLANNED exit: retarget or conclude. "Early vacate" is along-track (`RolloutExitGate.IsVacateAwayFromPlannedExit`, 350 ft short) under a laterally-clear conjunct; never raise 350 toward a claimed spacing floor. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-26
- [ROL-27] Refuse a handoff route that re-crosses the landing runway at BOTH sites via the ONE `HandoffRouteReCrossesLandingRunway()`; decline only while ON the runway with the exit ahead (both conjuncts), else conclude via `ConcludeLandingExitOnRunway()` on the pavement, `ConcludeLandingExitOffRunway()` off it (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-27
- [ROL-28] `MatchEarlyVacateExit` measures along-track PER EXIT and must never compare against `DistanceFromThresholdFeet`, which is from the landing threshold and breaks at displaced thresholds. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-28
- [ROL-29] `IsHandoffRouteReachable` must gate every landing-exit handoff re-route: a route whose first segment the aircraft is not essentially already on must CONCLUDE guidance, never steer the tone at it. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-29
- [ROL-30] `TryEarlyExitHandoff`'s re-crossing decline returns FALSE, discards the rejected route (`_route`, `_destinationNodeId`) and restores `LandingRollout` itself (`LoadRoute` left `RouteLoaded`); its off-runway arm concludes (`ConcludeLandingExitOffRunway`) and returns TRUE. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-30
- [ROL-31] The `UpdateLandingRollout` re-crossing decline speaks ONCE per targeted exit (`_rolloutCrossingDeclineAnnounced`, re-armed by `RetargetLandingExit` only when the exit changes, never the 1 s retry floor) as ONE utterance (`ComposeDeclineUtterance`), after retiring each milestone `DeclineSupersedesCallout` covers. Full: docs/invariants/landing-rollout.md#rol-31

Mirrored from surroundings.md, runway-holds.md and taxi-routing.md (they govern TaxiGuidanceManager.Rollout.cs and RunwayVacateResolver.cs; change them there and here together):
- [SUR-9] Passing callouts are queued and fire at the closest point of approach, abeam at the minimum, with NO start-up baseline; identity is kind + name + position (`SameFeatureMetres` 40 m, never widen); silent on runway pavement, and the probe never uses `Monitor.TryEnter` (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/surroundings.md#sur-9
- [HLD-7] Read runway geometry through the ONE `RunwayShape.For` (classifier, holds, Where-Am-I, takeoff, vacate, reach walk), bar `MatchHoldShortRunwayName` (start rows) and four callers with their own geometry; never read `Pavement*` directly or test membership on `Lat1..Lon2` alone; repair an outboard start ROW, never cap the extent (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/runway-holds.md#hld-7
- [RTE-2] Bridge a stranded stand (`BridgeOrphanParkingIslands`) ONLY when its island is all navdata `P` lead-ins within 50 m: never on/across runway pavement, onto a hold-short, a stand or another lead-in chain, never an island carrying a taxiway; runway-exit logic skips `IsStandBridge` edges (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-2

Mirrored from landing-exits.md (they govern the touchdown callout, the landing assist's runway switch and the exit-angle reads in TaxiGuidanceManager.cs, TouchdownCallout.cs and LandingFlareAssistManager.cs; change them there and here together):
- [EXIT-10] A touchdown runway correction is ONE `AnnounceInstruction` (`TouchdownCallout`): first retire every milestone due within the MEASURED `ROLLOUT_TOUCHDOWN_CORRECTION_LEAD_SEC` (re-measure when the wording changes), reached by `RolloutCalloutSupersession.ReachFeet` braking to taxi speed; turn-now only when already inside. Full: docs/invariants/landing-exits.md#exit-10
- [EXIT-12] The manual landing assist points its tones at the runway actually landed on for ONE engagement (`LandingAssistRunwaySwitch`) and restores the ARMED runway in `StopEngagement`; never let the switch outlive the engagement. Full: docs/invariants/landing-exits.md#exit-12
- [EXIT-13] The overshoot margin and the alignment handoff read how the exit leaves its OWN node (`LandingExit.DivergenceAngleDegrees` into `RolloutExitGate.OvershootMarginFor`/`IsAlignedWithExit`), never `ExitAngleDegrees`, the branch's sharpest turn (EDDB 24L M3: 100 ft for 291). Full: docs/invariants/landing-exits.md#exit-13
