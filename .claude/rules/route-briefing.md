# Route briefing rules

Loaded when Claude reads matching code. Background: docs/gemini.md. Full text of each rule: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md.

- [BRF-1] The briefing's `OsmPlanningGraph` is PLANNING-ONLY: rendered under `TaxiBriefingRenderer.OsmLabel` (or `XPlaneLabel` for apt.dat), never stored where a form or `TaxiGuidanceManager` can reach it, and given NO parking in its `TaxiGraph.Build`. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-1
- [BRF-2] Each taxi leg is a ROUTE PARAGRAPH from the computed route only (bar an unavailable leg's general-knowledge route, which says so), one CHECK LINE that never claims an agreement or difference it cannot support, then optional SUGGESTIONS, never a full alternative route. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-2
- [BRF-3] `BriefingStandPicker` finds SayIntentions' gate in the import's order: NAME, then ALIASES, the pin only when neither matched; never re-gate a name/alias match on the pin's reach, and an ordinary stand always beats an excluded one. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-3
- [BRF-4] Place leg ends with `TaxiBriefingPlanner.LegEndNode`, never the largest component alone, and never on a node whose piece lies across a runway (`PieceLiesAcrossARunway`); route starts still pass `excludeBridgeOnlyStandStubs: true`. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-4
- [BRF-5] `GeminiService.RealWorldTaxiQuestion` is an instruction, never output: never tell the AI to substitute data into it, keep `RouteBriefingText.RemoveEchoedTaxiQuestion` in BOTH providers, and remove only an echo that STARTS its line. Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-5
- [BRF-6] Use SayIntentions' data only for THIS flight (`SayIntentionsArrivalGate.IsThisFlight`): its runways win over the plan's, its gate comes via `GetAssignedStatusAsync`, every distance uses ONE unit, and turns come from `BriefingTurns`. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-6
- [BRF-7] The briefing's aircraft class comes from the SimBrief OFP ALONE (`AircraftSizeClass.Resolve` in `ElectronicFlightBagForm.BuildTaxiRoutesBlockAsync`), never the loaded aircraft or the sim's `WING SPAN`; navdata taxiway widths stay advisory notes (`TaxiBriefingPlanner.NarrowTaxiways`), never a routing constraint. Full: docs/invariants/route-briefing.md#brf-7
- [BRF-8] `GetRouteDescriptionPrompt` gets the web-search flag of the request carrying it: each provider's `DescribeRouteAsync` passes its own `enableSearch`, and Claude's retry without the web_search tool passes `false`, never the first prompt reused, so a check line never claims charts it could not read.

Mirrored from gsx-stands.md (they govern the graph builds in TaxiBriefingGraphSource.cs and OsmPlanningGraph.cs; change them there and here together):
- [DCK-40] A stand has ONE name app-wide: `GetSelectableGates` to ACT on a stand, `GetNamedSpots` to name one and for every `TaxiGraph.Build` given parking; never build a pilot-heard list from `GetParkingSpots`, nor call the supplier per position update (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands.md#dck-40
- [DCK-41] Never feed `TaxiGraph.Build` a spot list other than navdata's own set: its parking pass sets `TaxiNodeType.Parking` and can MOVE A HOLD-SHORT; the exceptions are builds given no parking at all: the runway-rows-only ones and the briefing's `OsmPlanningGraph`. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands.md#dck-41

Mirrored from surroundings.md (it governs the `CurrentAirport.Resolve` call in TaxiBriefingGraphSource.cs; change it there and here together):
- [SUR-4] "Which airport am I at" is always `CurrentAirport.Resolve` -> `CurrentAirportResolver.Pick` (four true-distance passes, order load-bearing), never `GetNearbyAirportICAOs`; the catalog is never built on the UI thread (`SurroundingsCatalogCache.GetAsync` only) (more: see full).
