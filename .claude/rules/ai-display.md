# AI display reads, the camera and screenshots rules

Loaded when Claude reads matching code. Background: docs/gemini.md. Full text of each rule: docs/invariants/ai-display.md.

- [AI-1] ONE AI capture at a time app-wide (`Services/DisplayReadGate.Shared`): `ReadDisplay` AND `MainForm.DescribeSceneAsync` take the same gate, and the holder must RELEASE it before any modal dialog, or every later read answers "already in progress". Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-1
- [AI-2] `ScreenshotService` captures with `PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)` first, BitBlt fallback only behind `ScreenshotFrame.LooksBlank` (dark AND uniform, sampled inside the client rect); never send a frame it rejected to the AI. `CaptureAsync` runs on its own thread, bounded at 10 s. Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-2
- [AI-3] Camera switches go through `InstrumentViewRequest` (index 0-based, TYPE then INDEX, refuse a non-cockpit camera out loud); the restore writes neutral index, type, index on SEPARATE frames and confirms after a settle (`ConfirmHeldAsync`). Never verify on the first matching poll or gate on `MAX`. Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-3
- [AI-4] Never reinstate a silent multi-model fallback for Gemini calls — the model used must be exactly `UserSettings.GeminiModel`; a silent fallback hides which model produced a response. Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-4
- [AI-5] Do NOT send `thinkingConfig`/`thinkingBudget` to Gemini — `thinkingBudget` is deprecated/invalid on Gemini 3.x models (`thinking_level` is used instead) and can error if both are set. Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-5
- [AI-6] The Gemini HTTP timeout catch must NOT gate on `ex.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested` (false on a modern .NET HttpClient timeout) — catch `TaskCanceledException` as the timeout instead. Full: docs/invariants/ai-display.md#ai-6
