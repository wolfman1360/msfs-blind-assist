# FlyByWire flyPad EFB (A320 and A380) rules

Loaded when Claude reads matching code. Background: docs/flypad.md. Full text of each rule: docs/invariants/flypad.md.

- [FPD-1] A control drivable only by an L:var write must not be wired through the injected agent (`SimVar.SetSimVarValue` silently no-ops there); expose it as an app-side panel control instead. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-1
- [FPD-2] Never render the flyPad scrape as native WinForms controls; only a WebView2 HTML document gives NVDA full browse mode, with headings and static text reachable. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-2
- [FPD-3] Never wipe and rebuild the flyPad WebView2 DOM every poll (`innerHTML` replace), which steals screen-reader focus; use the keyed in-place reconcile only. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-3
- [FPD-4] The flyPad reconcile key must be element CONTENT, never the scrape idx, which is re-stamped every scrape and collides nodes across pages and sub-tabs. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-4
- [FPD-5] The reconcile key must strip dynamic state suffixes (`(active)`/`(called)`/`(selected)`), or a state change rebuilds the node and throws NVDA's focus off the control just activated. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-5
- [FPD-6] Wheel Chocks/Safety Cones are read-only status with no setter or click handler in FBW; never make them clickable. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-6
- [FPD-7] The Ground Payload/Fuel builders must own (suppress) every non-actionable section child, the CG-chart card and all tooltip nodes, or the scrape flattens into unreadable fragments. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-7
- [FPD-8] `setValue` on a flyPad SimpleInput must commit with a synthetic Enter keydown/keyup plus blur; FBW commits on Enter/blur, not onChange, so a plain value-set never reaches the sim. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-8
- [FPD-9] On the Ground Payload/Fuel pages, suppress the "Fill ... from SimBrief" caption tooltip and icon button, never the value input; the user imports via the Dashboard instead. Full: docs/invariants/flypad.md#fpd-9
