# Rules whose code the taxi entry points call

MIRRORS: each line below is copied word for word from its area's rule file, because the code it guards lives in or is called from these files, not all of which that area's globs cover (a file they also cover loads the line twice, harmlessly). Change a rule in its own file and here together; ClaudeContextBudgetTests fails if the two differ.

- [DCK-40] A stand has ONE name app-wide: `GetSelectableGates` to ACT on a stand, `GetNamedSpots` to name one and for every `TaxiGraph.Build` given parking; never build a pilot-heard list from `GetParkingSpots`, nor call the supplier per position update (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-40
- [DCK-41] Never feed `TaxiGraph.Build` a spot list other than navdata's own set: its parking pass sets `TaxiNodeType.Parking` and can MOVE A HOLD-SHORT; the exceptions are builds given no parking at all: the runway-rows-only ones and the briefing's `OsmPlanningGraph`. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-41
- [RTE-12] `TaxiGraph.DescribeLocation` runs on pool threads: pool-reachable queries take `_structureLock` inside TaxiGraph, its lazy index is read only under it, no post-Build mutation skips it; never widen the runway-start reach without the owner, nor drop the stand's near-runway gate (pavement, runway start, `IsNavdataHoldShort`) (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-12
- [SUR-9] Passing callouts are queued and fire at the closest point of approach, abeam at the minimum, with NO start-up baseline; identity is kind + name + position (`SameFeatureMetres` 40 m, never widen); silent on runway pavement, and the probe never uses `Monitor.TryEnter` (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/surroundings.md#sur-9
- [DCK-33] Hot paths must not regress: docking far-field math gated to <150 m or engaged, fired callout latches early-out, `TaxiAssistForm`'s gate list cached per ICAO, `SettingsManager.Save` writing outside its static lock. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-33
- [DCK-36] A per-ICAO gate-list cache keys on `GetGateListVersion(icao)` too, via `ShouldRebuildGateList` (never rebuilt on a downgrade); token-only consumers use static `ComputeGateListVersion`; a lost stand leaves NOTHING selected (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-36
- [HLD-7] Read runway geometry through the ONE `RunwayShape.For` (classifier, holds, Where-Am-I, takeoff, vacate, reach walk), bar `MatchHoldShortRunwayName` (start rows) and four callers with their own geometry; never read `Pavement*` directly or test membership on `Lat1..Lon2` alone; repair an outboard start ROW, never cap the extent (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/runway-holds.md#hld-7
- [SUR-1] Surroundings features are READOUT ONLY, never a `TaxiGraph.Build` input; a place becomes a destination only via `PlaceListBuilder`, BY POSITION (never a `(Name, Number, Suffix)` join); after a rebuild restore the pick or select NOTHING, never item 0 (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/surroundings.md#sur-1
- [RTE-4] Take-off assist's under-aircraft runway probe (`TryDetectRunwayUnderAircraft` -> `TaxiGraph.TryGetRunwayAtPosition`) must use a strict tolerance, `RunwayShape`'s own half-width with no +5m fudge, and stay gated on `_lastOnGround`; Where-Am-I's `DescribeLocation` keeps its +5 m on purpose. Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-4
- [RTE-6] Off-route detection must use perpendicular cross-track distance, never endpoint-distance comparisons, which break on long segments. Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-6
- [RTE-7] Off-route auto-recalc must stay gated on the route-joined latch `_hasJoinedRoute`, or the post-pushback taxi onto the first taxiway reads as off-route and silently trims the entered clearance. Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-7
- [RTE-11] "Where Am I" is ground-only by design (gated on `_lastOnGround`); runway detection must use `TaxiGraph.RunwayCenterlines`, never rely on `taxi_path.type='R'` edges (the DB has none). Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-11
- [RTE-27] The start grace window (`START_WARNING_CHATTER_GRACE_SEC`, 12.5 s) follows either start warning: turn, destination-ahead and curve callouts wait it out when safe (`StartWarningChatterGate`), the taxiway-change callout defers (`TaxiwayChangeGate`); never make any of them skip, never gate hold-short or runway-crossing callouts on it. Full: docs/invariants/taxi-routing.md#rte-27
- [DCK-14] Any cache holding STAND NAMES must key on `GateDataSource.GetGateListVersion`'s token as well as the ICAO, compared through `ShouldRebuildGateList`, or a graph built before GSX published keeps navdata's letters. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-14
- [GSX-7] "4.0.8" appears only in `GsxService.ReasonNoRemoteApi` and `GsxGateSelectAnnouncer.GateSelectUnsupportedMessage`, never 4.0.1; that message latches once per `TaxiAssistForm` (the announcer stays stateless), never via `UnavailableReason` or the Access GSX status. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-remote.md#gsx-7
- [HLD-4] Never disable auto-inserted runway-crossing hold-shorts: `ApplyAutoHoldShortPasses` runs only from `AdoptRoute`, the one place a route is adopted; never place a stop on any runway's pavement, and a `StartGuidance` caller that stays in `Taxiing` or `HoldShort` must speak `ConsumeStartHoldCue()` (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/runway-holds.md#hld-4
- [STR-18] The route-start turn cue has ONE owner (`RouteStartTurnCue`), composed via `ComposeInitialTurnCue` from `LoadRoute` and the handoff RE-ANCHOR, never on the first taxiing frame; delivered once via `ConsumeInitialTurnCue()`, the per-frame one-shot included, angle from `ComputeSteeringHeadingError`, both sides true north (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/taxi-steering.md#str-18
- [DCK-4] The `.py` per-aircraft stop offset must apply to ALL non-deice gates, `.ini` gates included. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-4
- [DCK-5] `GsxOffset.Zero` must be a strict no-op (skip the shift); any resolver miss at any layer degrades to Zero, never throws or half-applies. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-5
- [EXIT-9] `BeginRunwayEndCountdownRollout` must install the graph, provider and ICAO and START the tone (no LoadRoute ran); only it and `BeginLandingRolloutNoGraph` raise `PositionStreamRequired` (no other `LandingRollout` entry restarts the stream); distance to the end is `RunwayFrame.DistanceToEnd`, never raw `Runway.Length`. Full: docs/invariants/landing-exits.md#exit-9
