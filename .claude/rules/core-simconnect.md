# Core SimConnect and MainForm rules

Loaded when Claude reads matching code. Background: docs/architecture.md. Full text of each rule: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md.

- [SIM-1] The SimConnect data-definition budget is 1000 per connection; never register a var as BOTH an individual def AND a batch-covered def — a Continuous+IsAnnounced var skips its individual registration and reads the shared batch cache. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-1
- [SIM-2] `SetupDataDefinitions` must register bulk/batch vars LAST, after the fixed/critical defs (AIRCRAFT_INFO/ATC/position), so a def-count overflow degrades gracefully instead of stranding aircraft detection. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-2
- [SIM-3] Watch `registration.log`'s `approxTotalDefs`; never let a new var push a connection's total definitions near/over 1000 without splitting to a second SimConnect connection. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-3
- [SIM-4] `RequestVariable(key, forceUpdate:true)` must also work for batch-covered vars: `ProcessContinuousBatch` must consult `forceUpdateVariables`, or a forced re-read of an unchanged batch value silently no-ops. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-4
- [SIM-5] `SimConnectManager.RequestVariable` must stay safe from ANY thread: off the UI thread it POSTS itself there (`UiThreadGate`; a post refused at shutdown is dropped, never run inline). Never read `continuousVariableIndexMap` or issue `RequestDataOnSimObject` from a pool thread directly. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-5
- [SIM-6] Request ids 341–348 (camera reads), 505–508 (guidance frames) and 600–607 (ground-traffic sweeps) are reserved: never assign one elsewhere, and grep for raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)` casts before choosing a new id, because a reused id REPLACES the existing request. Pinned by `GroundTrafficRequestIdTests` and `CameraReadWaitersTests`. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-6
- [SIM-7] A delivered value is a CHANGE only past its `SimVarDefinition.ChangeTolerance` (else the shared 0.001), through the one `SimConnectManager.IsValueChange`; never widen it for a var whose reader acts on a small cumulative change, or one `Md11SeedGate` counts. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-7
- [SIM-8] The calc-path probe MUST report its verdict: `CalcPathVerdict.LogLine` on both outcomes, `PilotWarning` spoken when an aircraft registering `MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` concludes UNVERIFIED (others conclude at once, logged, unspoken by design). MainForm's timer gates on that registration, never a type list. Never make the verdict silent again. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-8
- [SIM-9] The `MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` read-back lags its write by one round, so the match must accept the PREVIOUS nonce too (`SimConnect.BridgeProbe.IsEcho`); comparing only the current nonce means the probe never converges and `CalcPathVerified` stays false. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-9
- [SIM-10] A380 FCU events (`A32NX.FCU_*`) must NEVER wait on the calc-path probe (`SimConnectManager.IsFbwFcuEvent`), and that bypass must stay gated on `AircraftCode == "FBW_A380"`: the A32NX shares the names but keeps its working `TransmitClientEvent` fallback. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-10
- [SIM-11] `SetLVar`'s MobiFlight calc-path routing must gate on `CalcPathVerified`, never on bare `IsMobiFlightConnected`, which is true even with no WASM module installed. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-11
- [SIM-12] `SetLVar` keeps stock SimVar names (`TRANSPONDER STATE:1`) and every name with a space off the L:var calc path. Colon names take the data-def write too; for a colon-indexed add-on L:var (`B787_IRS_Knob_State:1`, [VAR-2]) that is unmeasured, not a rule: move it to the calc path only if an in-sim read-back shows that write reverting. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-12
- [SIM-13] H: events always go to the MobiFlight channel whenever `IsMobiFlightConnected`; dotted events must wait for `CalcPathVerified` (queued, bounded, flushed on verify or probe-conclude) — never fire one before the probe concludes, except [SIM-10]'s A380 `A32NX.FCU_*` events, which never wait. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-13
- [SIM-14] The status-display auto-refresh repaint must be a LEADING-edge one-shot coalesce, never a restart-per-push trailing debounce, which starves under high-frequency PFD/ISIS streams. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-14
- [SIM-15] `UpdateDisplayText` must always refresh `displayValues` from `GetCachedVariableValue` first; cached `displayValues` alone go stale for any def whose `ProcessSimVarUpdate` returns `true`. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-15
- [SIM-16] The per-event "is this var in any panel display" gate must use the cached `GetDisplayVarNamesCached()` HashSet — never call a def's `GetPanelDisplayVariables()` per SimVar event; it rebuilds its whole dictionary every call. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-16
- [SIM-17] Every calc-path event string must be unique per call (`SimConnectManager.BuildCalcEventCode` prefixes `{seq} 0 *`): MobiFlight drops byte-identical consecutive commands, so a toggle could switch on and never off. The dedup keys on text, not elapsed time. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-17
- [SIM-18] The "Frame" system event is subscribed only while a consumer holds `StartFrameRateMonitoring` (the Sim Performance window), never unconditionally in `SetupEvents`: it costs one `ReceiveMessage` dispatch per rendered frame on the UI thread, app-wide, for a window nobody has open. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-18
- [SIM-19] A SIM_FRAME + CHANGED own subscription is seeded by a ONCE on `FreshReadPolicy.SeedRequestId` (def id + 900000, no map) only once `OnRecvSimobjectData` is attached (`SeedSimFrameSubscriptions` after `SetupEvents`, after re-registration): `SetupDataDefinitions`' `DoEvents` drains earlier answers. A seed answers no fresh-read waiter. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-19
- [SIM-20] Never add a `SimConnectManager.SendEvent` caller off the UI thread (`Task.Run`, a pool timer, after `ConfigureAwait(false)`): it maps each new event name into the unlocked `eventIds` Dictionary, bumping a non-atomic `nextEventId`. Marshal first, or `await` the delay on the UI thread. The FBW A320's `DeferReadback` sends are a known race. Full: docs/invariants/core-simconnect.md#sim-20

Mirrored from md11.md (they govern SimConnectManager code; change them there and here together):
- [MD11-8] A walked control's state var is consumed by `ProcessSimVarUpdate` during the walk, so no forced read reaches MainForm's combo refresh mid-walk; the walker reads via `ReadFreshAsync` on the read's OWN request id, never the subscription's, and SIM_FRAME subscriptions are seeded. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/md11.md#md11-8
- [MD11-16] Every MD-11 write path refuses ALOUD, before writing, when it cannot reach the aircraft: ask `CalcWriteCanLand` (calc bus) or `CanSendEvent` (stock event), never bare `CanExecuteCalculatorCode`; the probe check never moves into `ExecuteCalculatorCode` ([VAR-3]). Re-arm a NEGATIVE verdict on aircraft switch, keep a VERIFIED one. Success is silent. Full: docs/invariants/md11.md#md11-16
- [MD11-17] The `MD11MCDU` subscription never delivers the current page, so `RequestAll` keeps a start-up ONCE snapshot on a DIFFERENT request id. The window restores the cursor by ROW IDENTITY and polls only while visible; ONE `Md11McduDataManager` per connection. (more: see full) Full: docs/invariants/md11.md#md11-17

Mirrored from gsx-stands-docking.md, surroundings.md and gsx-remote.md (they govern SimConnectManager code; change them there and here together):
- [DCK-34] A SimConnect heading (`PLANE HEADING DEGREES TRUE`/`MAGNETIC`) arrives in the unit its `AddToDataDefinition` asks for: degrees in the position, AI-traffic, visual-guidance and flare definitions, radians in the hotkey, take-off and hand-fly ones, converted once on receipt. Never convert `AircraftPosition.HeadingMagnetic` again. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-stands-docking.md#dck-34
- [SUR-10] The surface-change callout (`SurfaceChangeGate`) has its own switch, is not behind `SuppressCheck`, speaks only a surface FAMILY change confirmed by `ConfirmMetres` from its first reading; other `lastKnownPosition` writers must carry the surface fields forward (more: see full). Full: docs/invariants/surroundings.md#sur-10
- [GSX-20] "GSX available" for the `.ini` gate overlay, deice pads and profile stop positions is `GsxService.CouatlStarted` OR `SimConnectManager.GsxCouatlStartedLVar`, never the Remote flag alone; `GsxService` itself still touches SimConnect nowhere. Full: docs/invariants/gsx-remote.md#gsx-20

Mirrored from a32nx-fenix.md (it governs the queued-event re-arm in SimConnectManager.EventSend.cs and the panel's echo arm in MainForm.PanelBuilder.cs; change it there and here together):
- [A320-38] Every MSFSBA-origin FCU write arms its dial-callout echo BEFORE the send, keys from `FcuEchoKeys.For(evt, FcuSources, FcuConfirmation)` (`ArmFcuEchoFor`, `OnPanelButtonFiring`; the calc-code V/S set arms the same two directly); a queued dotted event re-arms when `FlushPendingCalcEvents` sends it (`QueuedEventDispatched`). Full: docs/invariants/a32nx-fenix.md#a320-38
