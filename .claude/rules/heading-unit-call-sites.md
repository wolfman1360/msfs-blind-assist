# Heading-unit rule for files that read a heading SimConnect delivered

MIRRORS: copied word for word from simconnect-data.md, whose globs leave these files out; change both together (ClaudeContextBudgetTests checks).

- [DCK-34] A SimConnect heading (`PLANE HEADING DEGREES TRUE`/`MAGNETIC`) arrives in the unit its `AddToDataDefinition` asks for: degrees in the position, AI-traffic, visual-guidance and flare definitions, radians in the hotkey, take-off and hand-fly ones, converted once on receipt. Never convert `AircraftPosition.HeadingMagnetic` again. Full: docs/invariants/simconnect-data.md#dck-34
