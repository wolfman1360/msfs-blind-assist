    /// detection) and <see cref="SwitchAircraft"/> (a mid-session profile change from the Aircraft
    /// menu, which never disconnects). Split across the two, they drifted: only the timer path
    /// existed, so a session that began on a profile registering no probe target — the PMDG 737/777,
    /// HS787, iFly or Fenix — concluded UNVERIFIED and silently, and that verdict then stood for an
    /// MD-11 selected afterwards. Every MD-11 write was refused "unavailable" for the rest of the
    /// connection with a perfectly healthy calc path, and no warning was ever spoken because the
    /// conclusion had been reached on the previous profile. It also closes the older, quieter half
    /// of the same bug: a PMDG → FBW switch left a stale conclusion that dropped SetLVar to the
    /// unreliable data-def write and dotted events to the legacy transport, with nothing said.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ A verdict of VERIFIED is KEPT, and only a negative one is cleared. What the probe
    /// establishes is that the MobiFlight WASM executes an RPN write and it lands
    /// (<c>L:MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE</c> through <c>MF.SimVars.Set</c>) — a property of the MODULE and
    /// the connection, which an aircraft switch does not touch; the aircraft supplies only the
    /// data-def registration the read-back uses, which matters for REACHING a verdict, not for
    /// whether writes land once one is reached. Clearing a positive verdict as well cost a
    /// guaranteed degraded window on every Aircraft-menu switch and bought nothing: for at least
    /// two probe ticks (the timer is 1500 ms and the read-back lags its write by one round)
    /// <c>CalcPathVerified</c> was false, so every FBW <c>SetLVar</c> fell back to the data-def
    /// write CLAUDE.md calls unreliable for FBW L:vars — overhead switches revert silently — and
    /// every dotted A32NX FCU event was queued instead of sent. With no WASM module installed the
    /// window is the probe's full 40 × 1500 ms ≈ 60 s, after which <c>FlushPendingCalcEvents</c>
    /// replays a minute of queued heading/altitude/speed sets at once and drops anything past the
    /// 64-entry cap. Nothing names a failure the positive clear prevents: a calc path that died
    /// mid-connection fails its writes whether or not the flag says so, and the probe does not
    /// re-run once it has concluded anyway.
