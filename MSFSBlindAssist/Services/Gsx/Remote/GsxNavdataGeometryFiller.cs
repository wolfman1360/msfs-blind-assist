///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why it exists.</b> GSX publishes <c>heading</c>, <c>type</c>, <c>hasJetway</c> and
/// <c>airlineCodes</c> only for a stand a profile section covers. Every other stand arrives with a
/// position, <c>uiType</c> and <c>maxWingspan</c> 999 alone. Live at KSAN (2026-10-07) that was 75
/// of 79 stands; the installed profile is LatinVFR's, written for a different scenery, and its 4
/// matching sections are exactly the 4 stands with a heading. At KSFO, with no profile, it was 208
/// of 208. <c>GateDataSource.DropUnusableHeadings</c> threw every one of them away, so a pilot was
/// left with 4 stands after touchdown and SayIntentions' assigned Gate 115 could not be found.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why navdata is the right donor, measured.</b> Navdata stays authoritative for stand GEOMETRY
/// (see <see cref="GsxConcourseLetterFiller"/>'s doc for the one measured exception, the concourse
/// LETTER). All 75 KSAN stands sit 0.36-4.50 m (median 2.16) from a same-numbered navdata stand.
/// Where GSX and navdata BOTH publish a heading (187 KJFK stands), they agree to a median 0.24
/// degrees, max 6.68, with no 180-degree flips. Live at RJAA (stock scenery, no profile) all 154
/// stands have their navdata stand within 5.2 m. The POSITION stays GSX's: the offset is navdata
/// converting metres to degrees with a flat 111,132.954 m per degree where GSX uses the WGS84
/// ellipsoid, so GSX's point is the more precise one, and that scale bends a heading by at most
/// 0.13 degrees (full measurement under DCK-42).
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Only gaps, never a second opinion.</b> A heading GSX published, or one the <c>.ini</c> join
/// recovered (GSX's own <c>this_parking_pos</c>, joined first), is never touched; the same for a
/// size GSX published. A stand neither source can orient stays NaN, and
/// <c>DropUnusableHeadings</c> still drops it.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Which row is the same stand.</b> Navdata rows only (their radius is FEET, DCK-7), with the
/// spot's NUMBER, within <see cref="MatchRadiusMetres"/> (<see cref="GsxStandLetterMatch.MatchRadiusMetres"/>,
/// whose doc carries the measurement). When one of them carries the spot's own SUFFIX, only those
/// count: a MARS parent "20" is a different, wider stand from its child "20A", and siblings such as
/// EGSS 15/15R (9.4 m apart, 19.7 degrees) used to refuse each other, so the stand was dropped
/// (simulated over the fs2024 navdata: 53 such stands refused and 3 given a sibling's size before,
/// 3.3 and 1.5 after). Candidates left that disagree with the NEAREST one on heading by more than
/// <see cref="MaxHeadingDisagreementDegrees"/> are REFUSED, never arbitrated, and nothing is taken
/// from a refused match. An UNNUMBERED stand (Number 0, KSFO's Northwest parking) matches an
/// unnumbered row, and only when exactly one is in range: unnumbered stands sit a median 59.5 m
/// apart and none within 14.5 m of another. The concourse LETTER is deliberately not compared:
/// navdata's letter is wrong on 46 of 222 KJFK stands that are the same physical stand (see
/// <see cref="GsxConcourseLetterFiller"/>), so a letter test would refuse true donors.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The jet bridge and the airlines, unconfigured stands only [DCK-44].</b> A stand flagged
/// <see cref="ParkingSpot.GsxUnconfigured"/> (GSX sent no <c>heading</c> and no <c>hasJetway</c>:
/// no profile covers it) has no GSX opinion on either, so an accepted donor also lends
/// <see cref="ParkingSpot.HasJetway"/> and, when it has any, <see cref="ParkingSpot.AirlineCodes"/>.
/// Without it 53 of KSAN's 75 recovered gates read "no jetway": the label loses "(Jetway)" and
/// docking says "Door on your left" for a jet bridge, a regression against the navdata list the
/// recovered one replaces at a profile-less airport. NEVER for a stand that is not flagged: KJFK's
/// Gate 1A lacks only its heading, GSX published its jet-bridge flag and airline codes, and only the
/// heading is borrowed.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The size.</b> Navdata's <see cref="ParkingSpot.Radius"/> is FEET and a GSX spot's is METRES
/// (DCK-7), so it is converted. <see cref="ParkingSpot.MaxWingspanMeters"/> becomes twice that
/// radius, because <see cref="ParkingSpot.FitsAircraft"/>'s navdata rule is "the radius holds the
/// half-span". The fit filter therefore answers exactly what it answers on a navdata list, and
/// SayIntentions' position match (SI-7) gets a real radius rather than 999/2 m.
