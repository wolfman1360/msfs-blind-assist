/// ICAO — parsed by <see cref="GsxProfileParser"/> and overlaid on navdata by
/// <see cref="GsxNavdataMerger"/>. Parsed profiles are cached per (path, last-write-time).</item>
/// <item>The navdata provider, unchanged.</item>
/// </list>
/// The Remote API path takes exactly THREE things from outside the API, all narrow and all
/// documented at their call sites below: the docking STOP POSITION from the GSX <c>.ini</c>
/// (<see cref="GsxStopPositionJoiner"/>), the CONCOURSE LETTER from navdata
/// (<see cref="GsxConcourseLetterFiller"/>, name-only, position-matched), and the HEADING and SIZE
/// GSX left out of any stand, from the same navdata stand (<see cref="GsxNavdataGeometryFiller"/>,
/// gaps only: mostly the stands no GSX profile section covers, which also take the jet-bridge flag
/// and airline codes, but also a covered stand GSX sent without one, such as KJFK's Gate 1A).
/// Everything GSX does publish (the coordinates, and the heading, radius, size and jetway/VDGS
/// metadata of a configured stand) stays authoritative, which is why this path never calls
/// <see cref="GsxNavdataMerger"/> wholesale.
