/// Reads every surroundings tier for one airport into one feature list plus the airport's fuel line
/// and frequencies — <see cref="SurroundingsCatalogCache"/>'s BuildSupplier. Tiers, in merge order:
/// navdata stands (the required base: the airport box and the facts come from it), GSX terminals, OSM
/// buildings and the installed scenery package. The order matters because
/// <see cref="AirportFeatureCatalog.Build"/>'s rank sort is stable.
///
/// <para>Slow on a first visit (a scenery scan, a network fetch), so it runs on a thread-pool
/// thread only — never on the UI thread or a position update. The OSM fetch is started first and
/// collected last, so it overlaps the scenery scan. Every tier after navdata is read through
/// <see cref="SurroundingsTier"/>, so one failing tier costs only itself.</para>
///
/// <para>The result is DEGRADED when an optional tier was not served — it threw, refused, was
/// still out when the wait ran out, or the scenery scan was short — so the cache rebuilds it
/// later instead of keeping it for the session. A tier with nothing to add is not degraded.</para>
