/// HeadwindSim A330-900neo ("A339X") accessibility definition.
///
/// The Headwind A330neo is a fork of the FlyByWire A32NX — it shares the A32NX L-var
/// surface, the same systems model, FCU, ECAM/E-WD, MCDU (read over the Coherent debugger,
/// with the FBW SimBridge relay as fallback), and the shared <c>fbw-common</c> flyPad EFB (Coherent "- EFB"
/// view). It is modelled with the A32NX 2-spool engine vars
/// (<c>A32NX_ENGINE_N1/N2:1|2</c>), NOT the A380's 4-engine / N3 surface — so the
/// A320 definition is the correct, near-complete base.
///
/// Consequently this class INHERITS the full FlyByWire A320 definition (variables,
/// panels, hotkeys, FCU value-entry windows, EWD/SD decode, MCDU, flyPad EFB, taxi/
/// visual-guidance profiles) and overrides only what genuinely differs on the A330:
///   • identity (name / code / ICAO),
///   • the Coherent MCDU view needle used by the D / Shift+D flight-info readout
///     (A339X-named instruments instead of A32NX-named),
///   • a widebody visual-guidance profile (heavier airframe, higher Vref),
///   • THE ALTIMETER READ PATH (below).
///
/// ⚠ BARO/ALTIMETER divergence (root-caused 2026-07-02 against the installed
/// A339X v0.9-alpha.1): although the A339X fbw.wasm string table CONTAINS the new
/// FBW baro display words (<c>A32NX_FCU_EFIS_L_DISPLAY_BARO_VALUE_MODE</c>,
/// <c>A32NX_FCU_LEFT_EIS_BARO_HPA</c>, …), those values observably never reach
/// MSFSBA's SimConnect cache on this build — the mode read stuck at 0 (= STD), so
/// the B-key ALWAYS said "Altimeter standard" and the knob-change announce never
/// fired. The fix reads the STOCK sim altimeter instead, which every FBW generation
/// keeps in sync: <c>KOHLSMAN SETTING MB:1</c> (value), <c>KOHLSMAN SETTING STD:1</c>
/// (STD flag — the A380 precedent; the A339X wasm handles BAROMETRIC_STD_PRESSURE),
/// and <c>A32NX_FCU_EFIS_L_BARO_IS_INHG</c> (display-unit preference, present in the
/// A339X wasm). The base's SET paths are untouched — <c>A32NX.FCU_EFIS_L/R_BARO_SET</c>
/// and <c>_BARO_PULL/_PUSH</c> are all present in the A339X wasm, so the Ctrl+B
/// window's value/STD/unit writes work through the base.
///
/// Dead-surface sweep (same session): everything else the base depends on IS present
/// in the A339X package — A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_* (H/S/A/V readouts),
/// A32NX.FCU_*_SET, LOC/APPR/FD/LS light vars, LS push events, A32NX_Ewd_LOWER_*
/// memo codes — so no other repoint was needed offline.
///
/// LIVE-VERIFICATION TODO (this is an alpha airframe):
///   • Baro fix: B in QNH reads the value; knob turns announce; STD pull/push tracks
///     KOHLSMAN SETTING STD:1; unit selector flips the readout order; Ctrl+B window
///     mode agrees and its set/STD/unit controls still work (base events). The EFIS
///     Captain/F.O. panel display rows + Baro Push/Pull button readbacks are repointed
///     at the stock STD flags too (GetPanelDisplayVariables/GetButtonStateMapping
///     overrides below) — verify the F/O side actually tracks KOHLSMAN SETTING STD:2
///     (the Captain flag is confirmed; :2 assumes the A339X drives both altimeters).
///   • Spot-check Shift+H/S/A/V FCU readouts + Ctrl+P LOC/APPR/FD labels + Alt+E EWD
///     memos + Shift+M MCDU + D/Shift+D — present in the package, but the baro case
///     proved "present in the wasm" ≠ "delivered"; the same stock-var override
///     pattern applies if any turn out silent.
///   • Ctrl+Shift+D DCDU with a live datalink uplink: the "DCDU" view needle
///     substring-matches A339X_DCDU, the scrape keys on the svg.dcdu markup, and the
///     soft keys fire the fork-shared H:A32NX_DCDU_* events — all expected to work
///     unchanged, but none of it has been exercised against the A339X yet.
///   • Calibrate the glidepath / flare biases below against a coupled ILS autoland.
