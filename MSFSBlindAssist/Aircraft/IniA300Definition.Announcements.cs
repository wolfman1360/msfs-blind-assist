/// moves them (<see cref="A300Announcements"/>), and the altitude window when MSFSBA did not set it

/// later, when the next continuous batch ends (one sentence for every light changed since), so each
/// change is kept only when the announcer was not suppressed at the moment it was decided. Every other switch
