/// When the A300's light changes are spoken ([A300-24]): as one sentence (<see cref="A300LampCallouts"/>)
/// at the first batch end once they are due, netted per light, so a light that went on and back off since
/// the last sentence says nothing.
///
/// The light power flags and the fault flags reach MSFSBA on separate once-a-second subscriptions, so the
/// aircraft's own order is lost, both ways (measured 2026-10-09): on external power on, the cabin regulator 2
/// fault cleared 500 ms BEFORE the AC light power rose and MSFSBA heard the power first; on external power
/// off, the rudder travel limiter 2 fault arrived a second before the power flag. Either way MSFSBA said a
/// light on that the cockpit never lit, then off. So a first change waits <see cref="GatherMs"/> (one
/// subscription period, for a power flag still on its way), and a power change holds everything
/// <see cref="SettleMs"/>. Like the fleet, a power change still speaks every light it lights or darkens,
/// once, when the power has settled.
///
/// A light going dark is spoken only once it has stayed dark <see cref="OffHoldMs"/>, the iFly 737's flash
/// filter (owner, 2026-10-10): a light that lights again inside the hold says nothing, so a flashing light
/// (the autoland warning light) reads as one "on" at its first batch end, and "off" once it stops. An off
/// while a power change settles is not held: it nets in the power's own sentence. Pure.
