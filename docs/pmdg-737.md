# PMDG 737-800 NG3 Patterns

Reference for working with `PMDG737Definition`, `PMDGNG3DataManager`, `PMDGNG3DataStruct`, and `PMDG737CDUForm`. Companion to the general PMDG patterns in [pmdg-777.md](pmdg-777.md).

## Scope

Only the 737-800 BW HD is currently supported. The data struct's `AircraftModel` field (`ushort`) discriminates variants if -600 / -700 / -900 support is added later. `EVT_*_600` and `EVT_*_800` entries are both in `EventIds`, so wiring a variant is largely a one-line `_simpleEventMap` change.

## Panel structure

Overhead: Electrical, ADIRU, Hydraulics, Fuel, Engines, Anti-Ice, Air Systems,
Lights, Signs, Oxygen, Wipers, Flight Controls, Flight Recorder

Glareshield: Warnings, EFIS Captain, EFIS First Officer, MCP, Display Select
(absorbs both DU source selectors and NAVDIS source selectors)

Forward Panel: Landing Gear, Autobrake, GPWS, Instruments

Pedestal: Control Stand, Transponder, Fire Protection, Cargo Fire,
Communication, Flight Deck Door, Trim

Layout philosophy: mirror the PMDG 777 panel structure where logical; prioritize
screen-reader navigability over physical-cockpit faithfulness. No empty panels,
no location-based buckets, no tiny single-control panels except where there's no
sensible merge target (Landing Gear, Autobrake, Oxygen, Flight Recorder).

## SDK CDA names

`PMDG_NG3_Data` / `PMDG_NG3_Control` / `PMDG_NG3_CDU_0` / `PMDG_NG3_CDU_1`. Event base offset: `THIRD_PARTY_EVENT_ID_MIN = 69632` (same as the 777X).

`PMDGNG3DataStruct` ends with `byte[255]` reserved tail. Do **not** reuse the 777's 84 — SimConnect silently truncates on size mismatch.

## Two CDUs, not three

All CDU-side arrays are `[2]` (Captain = 0, F/O = 1). No observer CDU. `PMDG737CDUForm` uses the raw 0/1 ordering — no L/C/R dropdown swap like the 777 form has.

## CDU keys must use TransmitClientEvent, not the CDA write

`PMDG737CDUForm.SendCDUKey` dispatches every CDU key (letters, LSKs, function
keys, CLR/DEL/EXEC) via `SendEventViaTransmitWithTarget(eventId,
MOUSE_FLAG_LEFTSINGLE = 0x20000000)` — a self-contained press+release click.

Do **not** use the CDA path (`SendEvent(name, id, 1)`) the 777 form uses for most
keys. The NG3 FMC ignores the CDA `{eventId, 1}` write for CDU keypad events —
the click sound plays but nothing registers (same momentary-button behavior
proven for the MCP buttons). This is the documented PMDG convention (the SDK's
flight-director sample uses `MOUSE_FLAG_LEFTSINGLE`/`LEFTRELEASE`, and TFM uses
TransmitClientEvent for every CDU key) and matches the 777's own FMCCOMM/HOLD
path. A single `LEFTSINGLE` is a complete click — no separate `LEFTRELEASE` is
needed for CDU keys. Live-verified against the NG3 (CLR + letter entry) with
`tools/CDUTest` (`CDUTest 737 transmit <eventId> 536870912`).

`tools/CDUTest` is a standalone single-shot probe: it maps the chosen Control
CDA (`PMDG_NG3_Control` / `PMDG_777X_Control`) and fires one event via either
`cda` or `transmit`, for confirming which dispatch shape a given switch accepts.

## No FPA mode

NG3 has no `MCP_FPA` field, no `MCP_annunVS_FPA`, and the VS dialog drops the FPA toggle the 777 dialog has. The VS dialog gates input on `MCP_annunVS` (not `MCP_annunVS_FPA`).

## Annunciator naming differs from 777

Use the SDK header verbatim:
- `MCP_annunLVL_CHG` (not FLCH)
- `MCP_annunHDG_SEL` (not HDG_HOLD)
- `MCP_annunVOR_LOC` (not LOC)

Do **not** translate names from 777 conventions.

## MCP value entry is dialog-based

`MCP_Heading`, `MCP_Altitude`, `MCP_IASMach`, `MCP_VertSpeed` are declared with `PreventTextInput = true` in `GetPMDGVariables()` (same pattern as the 777). The panel UI shows them as read-only readouts; values are set via the four MCP dialogs accessed by Shift+H / Shift+S / Shift+A / Shift+V. This matches the 777 UX. Do not add inline text inputs.

## Autopilot window (Ctrl+P)

Input-mode Ctrl+P opens the engage-cluster window: CMD A/B, CWS A/B, F/D Captain and
First Officer, Approach, VOR LOC, A/T Arm, the disengage bar, the bank limit selector,
and the A/P and A/T disconnects. Rows are declared as data in
`Aircraft/PMDGAutopilotRows.cs` and bound to live UI by
`Forms/PMDG/PMDGAutopilotRowBinder.cs`; the window itself
(`Forms/PMDG/PMDGAutopilotWindow.cs`) is shared with the 777.

The per-axis mode buttons (LNAV, VNAV, LVL CHG, HDG SEL, ALT HOLD, VS) are NOT here by
design — they live in the Ctrl+H/S/A/V value dialogs, and duplicating them would put one
control in two places. Approach and VOR LOC ARE here, and are not an exception to that
rule: no value dialog carries them, so before this window they were reachable only from
the MCP panel. The test is "is it already in a dialog", not "is it a mode button".

The yoke A/P disconnect variable (`YOKE_APDisc` → `EVT_YOKE_L_AP_DISC_SWITCH`) was added
for this window: the event had always been in the ID table but no variable mapped to it,
so nothing could drive it.

Invariants:
- Every row actuates through `HandleUIVariableSet`, never a direct `SendPMDGEvent`.
- The 737's momentary MCP buttons are `UpdateFrequency.Never` and read their state from
  a SEPARATE annunciator field (`MCP_CmdA` → `MCP_annunCMD_A`), unlike the 777's, which
  are named for the annunciator directly. The row table records the pairing explicitly.
- Reads gate on `IPMDGDataManager.IsReady` and render `--` before the first CDA
  snapshot; a 0.0 read there is a sentinel, not a real position. Stateful toggle
  buttons (and the bank limit combo) are DISABLED until the snapshot arrives — a
  toggle press computes its flip target from the current state, which the sentinel
  would falsify; momentary buttons stay pressable, their press ignores the value.
- Presses call `MainForm.SuppressUiEcho` with the EXPECTED RESULTING value, not the
  press parameter — the echo gate is value-matched, so marking a press with 1 would
  let the matching disengage announce twice.
- Bank limit is a ComboBox, never a cycling button. Multi-position switches stay
  multi-position combos.
- Window hotkeys are native mnemonics carried as row DATA (`ApRowSpec.Mnemonic`,
  rendered by `PMDGAutopilotRowBinder.ApplyMnemonic`): CMD A **Alt+A**, CMD B
  **Alt+B**, Approach **Alt+P**, VOR LOC **Alt+O**, Bank Limit **Alt+L** (the combo's
  key lives on its text Label, whose mnemonic focuses the next control in tab
  order). Tests pin assignment, per-table uniqueness AND that every letter occurs
  in its label — a letter not in the label silently never becomes a hotkey.

## Altimeter access

ALTIMETER_SETTING is an MSFS simvar (not a PMDG var). It is NOT in the panel
tree. Set/read via existing global hotkeys:

- Input mode `Ctrl+B` → set the altimeter (input dialog accepts hPa 900–1060 or
  inHg 26.50–31.30; magnitude-based branching, locale-safe)
- Output mode `B` → read current altimeter setting in both units; announces
  "Altimeter standard" if at 29.92 inHg

Implementation in PMDG737Definition.HandleHotkeyAction. MainForm has no generic
fallback for these actions — every PMDG aircraft must implement them or the
hotkey silently does nothing.

## Guarded selector dispatch

Two primitives on IPMDGDataManager:

- `SendGuardedToggle(guard, switch)` — guard open → switch event WITHOUT parameter
  → guard close. Use for guarded 2-position toggles only.
- `SendGuardedSelector(guard, switch, targetPosition)` — guard open → switch
  event WITH targetPosition → guard close. Use for guarded ≥3-position selectors
  (battery, standby power, emergency exit lights).

PMDG737Definition.HandleUIVariableSet picks the right primitive by inspecting
`varDef.ValueDescriptions.Count`. Never call SendGuardedToggle for a 3-position
selector — the SDK ignores the user's target position and the switch silently
fails to move.

## Selector ValueDescriptions must match SDK enum positions verbatim

The panel UI sends the dropdown index as the position parameter to the sim. If the `ValueDescriptions` list order doesn't match the SDK's enum-position order, the user's pick silently triggers a different physical position — flight-relevant for things like speed reference, autobrake, N1 set.

When adding or editing any `Selector(...)` entry in `GetPMDGVariables`, cross-reference the corresponding SDK header comment (`PMDG_NG3_SDK.h`) and order the positions to match. If the SDK comment elides middle positions ("0: X ... N: Y"), look up the standard NG3 -800 cockpit layout and document the inferred middle positions in a code comment.

DU source selectors (`MAIN_MainPanelDUSel`, `MAIN_LowerDUSel`) have a "reverse sequence for FO" caveat: index 1 of the array reads positions in reverse enum order. Give the FO variant its own mirror-ordered `ValueDescriptions` list — don't share with the captain's.

## String display fields

`IRS_DisplayLeft[7]`, `IRS_DisplayRight[8]`, `ELEC_MeterDisplayTop[13]`, `ELEC_MeterDisplayBottom[13]`, `AIR_DisplayFltAlt[6]`, `AIR_DisplayLandAlt[6]`, `FMC_flightNumber[9]`.

`PMDGNG3DataManager` exposes a non-interface `GetStringFieldValue(string)` method for ASCII decoding — callers needing string content must cast `IPMDGDataManager` to `PMDGNG3DataManager`.

## Doors as annunciators

12 individual `DOOR_annun*` bools (FWD_ENTRY, FWD_SERVICE, AIRSTAIR, …) plus a 4-state `PED_FltDkDoorSel` enum. No 16-byte `DOOR_state[16]` array like the 777.

## Press-counter fields

`COMM_Attend_PressCount` and `COMM_GrdCall_PressCount` are byte counters that increment on each press. `ProcessSimVarUpdate` detects edges via signed-wrapping delta against the last known counter value (instance fields `_lastAttendPressCount` / `_lastGrdCallPressCount`).

## ACP observer slot is unused

`COMM_SelectedMic` is a 3-wide array in the SDK for binary compatibility, but the 737 cockpit has no observer ACP — index 2 always reads as 0 and is not exposed in the panel.

## Options.ini requirement

`737NG3_Options.ini` lives at:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Limitless_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Packages\Community\pmdg-aircraft-738\work\737NG3_Options.ini
```

Must contain:

```ini
[SDK]
EnableDataBroadcast=1
EnableCDUBroadcast.0=1
EnableCDUBroadcast.1=1
```

User-managed (same as the 777's options.ini workflow today).

## Fire handles need an active fire to test

PMDG NG3 mechanically locks fire handles in the "In" position unless a fire warning is active for the corresponding engine/APU. The `_guardedMap` entries for `FIRE_EngineHandle_1_Press` / `FIRE_APUHandle_Press` / `FIRE_EngineHandle_2_Press` chain `EVT_FIRE_UNLOCK_SWITCH_*` → `EVT_FIRE_HANDLE_*_TOP`, mirroring the 777 pattern; the SDK enforces the lock so presses are no-ops outside an active fire scenario.

`FIRE_HandlePos[3]` array indexing: `[0]=Engine 1, [1]=APU, [2]=Engine 2`. Inferred from sequential SDK event-ID ordering (`EVT_FIRE_HANDLE_ENGINE_1_TOP=697`, `_APU_TOP=698`, `_ENGINE_2_TOP=699`; `EVT_FIRE_UNLOCK_SWITCH_ENGINE_1=976`, `_APU=977`, `_ENGINE_2=978`). Same convention applies to `FIRE_HandleIlluminated[3]`. Verify in sim under an active fire scenario; if a tester reports the wrong handle moves on a fire press, swap the `DisplayName` strings on `FIRE_HandlePos_1` / `_2` (and on `FIRE_HandleIlluminated_1` / `_2`).

## EFB support

The PMDG 737-600 / -700 / -800 / -900 EFB has full parity with the PMDG 777. The 737 ships the
**byte-identical** EFB application bundle as the 777. The EFB is read and driven over the MSFS
Coherent debugger via the shared `coherent-pmdg-efb-agent.js` (generic agent that resolves controls
by TYPE, so new PMDG pages read automatically) + `CoherentPmdgEfbClient` + `FbwEfbForm` (the same
WebView2 form that the FBW flyPad uses). NO Community mod package is installed, NO HTTP bridge is
needed, and NO sim restart is required.

- Enabled via `IPMDGAircraft.HasEFBSupport => true` in `PMDG737Definition` — this single flag turns
  on the EFB plumbing (Coherent client startup) and the Shift+T dispatch (`MainForm` gates those on
  `HasEFBSupport`).
- Hotkeys: **Shift+T (input mode) = Captain EFB**, **Ctrl+Shift+T (input mode) = First Officer EFB**.
  The shared `FbwEfbForm.cs` shows the currently selected tablet side. Form title is computed in `MainForm.Dialogs.cs` and reads `"PMDG 737
  EFB"` for `PMDG_737` and `"PMDG 777 EFB"` otherwise.
- On startup, `Patching/LegacyEfbBridgeCleanup.cs` removes the retired Community packages
  (`zzz-pmdg-efb-accessibility`, `zzz-hs787-accessibility`) automatically. The old HTTP bridge
  (`EFBBridgeServer`) was deleted; Coherent transport is the only mechanism (shared with FBW A380).
- The agent's `collect()` carries live-validated noise-suppression rules (drop anonymous buttons +
  single-character runway-diagram glyphs; reject value-display labels so the METAR temperature can't
  bleed into the Toggle Weather / Weather Icao fields; clean icon-button collision names) — see the
  rules [PEFB-2]–[PEFB-4] in [invariants/pmdg-efb.md](invariants/pmdg-efb.md) and [pmdg-efb.md](pmdg-efb.md). All locked by `tools/pmdg-efb-test` (jsdom).

## Interior section

A dedicated "Interior" panel section exposes the cockpit/cabin items PMDG models as
plain L-vars (names + polarity verified directly against PMDG's behavior XMLs in
`pmdg-aircraft-738\SimObjects\...\attachments\pmdg\` — `73X_Cockpit_Behavior.xml`,
`73X_Cabin_Ceiling/Walls_Behavior.xml`, `73X_Galley_Fwd/Aft_Behavior.xml`). Every dispatch shape
below was live-verified CLOSED-LOOP on 2026-06-12 with `tools/PMDGDispatchTester` (new
`lvar` / `lvarget` / `kev` commands — write, read back, write the other way, read back).

- **Cockpit Furniture** — sliding windows (CA/FO), sun visors, window shades, headrests,
  rudder-pedal adjust, jumpseat, armrests, storage cubbies (side/doc/glareshield), cubby bar,
  cupholder drinks, and the binder cookie-stash easter egg (PMDG's model Update drives the
  reveal once `L:CubbyTrigger` is set with the cubby bar raised — both live-verified).
- **Cabin Bins** — all 38 overhead "SPACE BIN" click-spots individually + Open All / Close All.
- **Cabin Items** — window-blind raise/lower-all composites (87 blinds incl. EE-row),
  cabin/galley lights, galley + class-divider curtains, lavatory doors.
- **Galley** — water on/off + cold/warm (pushbutton radio-pairs: set one L-var, clear its
  opposite), sink taps, coffee valves, sanitizer pumps, power-outlet covers, the two secret
  compartments, the forward-airstair control panel, and the FAP ground-service switch.

**Undocumented switch events.** The airstair panel (retract 1646 / extend 1648 / lights 1654 /
standby 1658) and the FAP ground-service switch (2050) have NO defines in the public SDK header,
but PMDG's switch-number == event-offset convention holds: `event_base + N` moves the
corresponding `switch_N_73X` read-back L-var (all live-verified 2026-06-12; ground service
two-way 0↔100; lights is 3-position — param 0/1/2 → L-var 0/50/100). The airstair
extend/retract/standby buttons are PUSHBUTTONS — dispatch is press-and-release (param 1, 350 ms,
param 0) or the switch L-var latches pressed. Note: switch presses verified, but the actual
STAIR did not deploy on the test airframe (`DOOR_annunAIRSTAIR` stayed 0) — the airstair is an
airframe option and may also need standby armed; without it the switches are no-ops.

Key dispatch rules (all in the `0-cabin` region of `HandleUIVariableSet`):

- **Jumpseat + armrests: the CDA parameter IS the position (0 = stowed/down, 1 = extended/up),
  NOT a press.** Live-verified: `cda 71633 1` → `L:switch_2001_73X` = 100, `cda 71633 0` → 0;
  armrests 70638–70641 ↔ `L:switch_1006..1009_73X` identical. The first implementation exposed
  these as momentary buttons that always sent parameter 1 — they "worked once" (extend) and never
  went back. They are now COMBOS whose varKey is the PMDG-owned read-back L-var (0/100 display
  scale) and whose set dispatches the SDK event with the 0/1 position. A raw SetLVar to those
  switch L-vars reverts (SDK-owned read-backs, same family as the 777's `switch_NNN_a`) — the
  event is the actuator; do NOT let them fall through to the generic LVar branch.
- **Sliding windows are NOT a bare L-var set.** PMDG's VC click code toggles
  `L:Window_OpenClose_CA/FO` **and** fires `K:TOGGLE_AIRCRAFT_EXIT_FAST` with exit index
  16 (CA) / 17 (FO), gated on PMDG-owned `L:CanOpenWindows` (ground + slow). The dispatch
  replicates that atomically via MobiFlight calculator code (with an unguarded
  SetLVar+SendEvent fallback when MobiFlight is absent). Both directions live-verified.
- **Visor deploy is blocked while the same-side window is open** (mirrors PMDG's guard).
- **ATTEND / GRD CALL buttons** (`COMM_AttendCallBtn` / `COMM_GrndCallBtn`) dispatch the SDK
  events via CDA **parameter 1** — live-verified (press counters increment). **Parameter 0 ALSO
  registers as a press** on this event family (same as the CDU keys) — unlike the
  jumpseat/armrest family where the parameter is a position. Never assume one family's parameter
  semantics for another; probe each. The PMDG ground-call horn keeps sounding until the button
  is pressed a second time — PMDG behaviour, not a stuck dispatch.
- Plain L-var toggles (bins, shades, visors, blinds, lights, curtains, lav doors) and drag
  positions (headrests, rudder pedals, clamped 0–100) write-stick both directions — verified.
  Composite bin/blind buttons loop `SetLVar` over static lists (`s_binLvars` / `s_blindLvars`);
  L-vars not fitted on the loaded cabin layout are harmless no-ops.
- **Drag-position varKeys carry a `_SET` suffix** (`headrest_CA_drag_h_SET` etc., Name = the bare
  L-var). MainForm only renders the TextBox + Set numeric input for keys containing "_SET"; a
  no-ValueDescriptions var without it falls through to the plain-button branch, whose click
  always dispatches value 1 — the position slammed to 1/100 on every press ("only goes to one
  position"). Keep the suffix on any future numeric-input L-var.
- **Cabin item audio is positional.** Bins (BinIn/Out), blinds (BlindIn/Out), curtains
  (CurtainIn/Out) and lavatory doors (\*lavatoryIn/Out) have wwise sounds at their CABIN
  location — from the cockpit they're attenuated to near-silence, and the cabin/galley LIGHTS
  have no sound at all (visual-only). "No sound from the cockpit" does not mean the control
  failed; the app's state-change announcement is the confirmation channel.
- Seats themselves are **not movable** — `L:capt_seat` / `L:fo_seat` are model-variant
  visibility selectors, not positions. Headrests are the only adjustable seat part.

## AI display reads (Alt+P / Alt+N / Alt+E / Alt+S / Alt+I)

Five reads, a table of `Aircraft/AiDisplayRead.cs` in `Aircraft/Pmdg737DisplayReads.cs`,
dispatched by `BaseAircraftDefinition.TryReadDisplayFor`. The app moves the simulator camera to
the instrument view that frames the display, captures with `PrintWindow`, puts the camera back,
and only then makes the AI call.

| Key | Display | Instrument view |
|---|---|---|
| Alt+P | PFD | view 8 (index 7) |
| Alt+N | ND | view 8 (index 7) |
| Alt+E | EICAS (upper engine display) | view 2 (index 1) |
| Alt+S | Lower display unit (DU4) | view 2 (index 1) |
| Alt+I | ISFD (standby) | view 2 (index 1) |

**The indices are MEASURED on the live aircraft (2026-09-20, MSFS 2024 1.8.16.0), never read off
`cameras.cfg`.** Two of this aircraft's camera titles actively mislead: the camera titled "PFD"
(index 7) frames the captain's PFD *and* ND, and the one titled "EICAS" (index 1) frames the
ISFD, both engine display units and the first officer's ND besides. PFD and ND share a view, as
do Alt+E, Alt+S and Alt+I.

⚠️ Sharing a view does NOT mean consecutive reads leave the camera alone — an earlier draft of
this section said it did. The restore puts the pilot's own view back after EVERY read, so the
next read always starts from their view and plans a fresh switch. The saving existed only under
the no-restore design, where the camera stayed on the instrument view and the next read hit
`AlreadyThere`.

⚠️ **This aircraft's cameras are not where the others keep theirs, and where they ARE differs by
variant.** On the -600/-700/-800 `common/config/cameras.cfg` is a ~300-byte stub holding only the
eyepoint and the real list is per livery preset, e.g.
`presets/pmdg/PMDG 737-800 BW HD/config/cameras.cfg`. On the **-900 it is the other way round**:
the preset files are 48-byte `[MODULAR_MERGE] auto = true` stubs and the full list lives in
`common/config/cameras.cfg`. Read whichever of the two is not a stub. (Across the 21 -600/-700/-800
presets checked, the instrument order is identical — `0 MCP, 1 EICAS, … 7 PFD` — so the indices
below hold for every livery of those three.)

**Why the ISFD does not use the captain-panel view.** It is in that frame, but hard against the
right edge and clipped. In the EICAS view it sits well inside the frame and crops legibly — and
that is where `DisplayType.ISFD737`'s prompt already says it is, "between the captain's displays
and the Engine Display", so no prompt change was needed.

**Alt+S reads the lower display unit**, and it is the only route THIS APP offers to N2, oil
pressure, temperature and quantity, and engine vibration — the Engines panel carries the EEC,
ignition, start and fuel-lever SWITCHES and no secondary engine readouts at all.

⚠️ **That is a claim about the app, not about the simulator**, and the first draft got it wrong by
saying "the only way a blind pilot reaches" them. Measured on the live aircraft 2026-09-20: the
STOCK SimVars carry `TURB ENG N2` (87.22 %), `GENERAL ENG OIL PRESSURE` (62.84 psi),
`GENERAL ENG OIL TEMPERATURE` (76.59 °C) and `ENG FUEL FLOW PPH` (2347) with real per-engine
values. `ENG OIL QUANTITY` reads a flat 100 % and `ENG VIBRATION` 1.99 identically on both
engines — the stock engine model's defaults, not PMDG's (the frame measured for this feature had
oil quantity 68/75 and vibration 0.5/0.6). So three of the five could be ordinary always-live
panel rows on the Engines panel; that is a separate capability with its own in-sim test plan and
is deliberately NOT part of this change. Recorded so the next person does not re-measure it.
It shares the EICAS view, because that one frame holds both display units, so Alt+E and Alt+S
never move the camera between them. The unit is selectable (the LOWER DU knob switches it between
engine data and a navigation display), so `DisplayType.LowerDU737`'s prompt names which of the two
it found before reporting it, the way the MD-11's SD prompt handles its pages. The two prompts
exclude each other's numbers BY NAME, because both units are in the picture either way.

⚠️ **FUEL FLOW IS ON BOTH UNITS** — measured in the simulator 2026-09-20 in one frame: the upper
showed N1 88.4/88.4, EGT 790/771, FF 2.16/2.19; the lower showed N2 86.4/86.2, **FF 2.17/2.16**,
oil press 43/44, oil temp 77/77, oil qty 68/75, vib 0.5/0.6. The first draft of the lower prompt
said fuel flow "belongs to the Upper Engine Display, not this one" and told the model to skip it,
which would have dropped a value that is on screen. Only N1 and EGT are upper-unit-only.

**The lower unit's NAVIGATION DISPLAY branch is UNVERIFIED**, and so is the middle detent's label.
`MAIN_LowerDUSel` could not be moved from outside: absolute-position dispatch (parameter 0 and 2),
a MobiFlight `#69968` key event, and the `MOUSE_FLAG_LEFTSINGLE` click code were all sent through
simconnect-mcp and the selector stayed on position 1 every time, screen unchanged. The app's own
dispatch for this family is a different path and is not implicated. So the ND branch of the prompt
and the "NORM" label on position 1 both still want a pilot to flick the real knob.

It was added on 2026-09-20, after the camera work. It had been skipped on the stated grounds that
the PMDG 777 does not have it either — precedent rather than a reason. The 777 still has the same
gap, and its lower display is a genuinely different surface (a selectable synoptic), so it needs
its own measurement rather than a copy of this table.
