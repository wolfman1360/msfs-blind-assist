# Architecture

This document describes the core components and design patterns of MSFS Blind Assist.

## Core Components

### SimConnectManager
**File:** `SimConnect/SimConnectManager.cs`

- Handles all Microsoft Flight Simulator SimConnect communication
- Manages connection state and auto-reconnection
- Implements individual variable registration system
- Processes both LVars (local variables) and standard SimVars
- Supports teleport functionality via InitPosition structure
- Integrates with MobiFlight WASM module for H-variable support
- Subscribes to the SimConnect "Frame" system event on demand (`SimConnectManager.FrameRate.cs`), only while the File > Sim Performance window holds a request, for its frame-rate row (rule SIM-18; the window and its resource sampler live in `Forms/SimPerformanceForm.cs` and `Services/SimPerformance/`)

### SimConnect data-definition ceiling

**⚠️ THE SIMCONNECT DATA-DEFINITION CEILING — root-caused AND STRENGTHENED 2026-06 (commit 72ced22; see `tools/a380-finish-pass-2026-06.md`).** SimConnect caps a client connection at **1000 data definitions ("objects") + 1000 requests** ([MSFS SDK: "TOO_MANY_OBJECTS… maximum is 1000"](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Programming_Tools/SimConnect/API_Reference/Structures_And_Enumerations/SIMCONNECT_EXCEPTION.htm)). MSFSBA registers each var as a native SimConnect data def (`AddToDataDefinition("L:NAME"…)`), so each counts against that budget — it is NOT MobiFlight's 64-string cap (MSFSBA bypasses that channel for bulk reads). The limit is **per SimConnect connection but RESETS on aircraft switch** (MSFSBA clears + re-registers, `nextDataDefinitionId`→1000), so effectively **per-aircraft**. It is identical on **MSFS 2020 and 2024**. This is a global rule that applies to every aircraft definition, not just one airframe — this is why it lives here rather than in a per-aircraft doc.

- **The bug it caused:** `StartContinuousMonitoring` registered every Continuous+IsAnnounced var a SECOND time into a `CONTINUOUS_BATCH_n` def (on top of its individual def). The A380 used ~1083 defs and overflowed; the 2nd batch's `AddToDataDefinition` failed wholesale (`TOO_MANY_OBJECTS`/`UNRECOGNIZED_ID`), and that async exception disrupted the AIRCRAFT_INFO/ATC one-shot → `IsFullyConnected` never set → "MSFS detected but every hotkey says not connected".
- **THE FIX (3 layers, all in `SimConnectManager.cs`):** (1) **Headroom** — `RegisterAllVariables` now SKIPS the individual def for batch-covered vars (Continuous+IsAnnounced+!ExcludeFromBatch); they read their on-demand value from `lastVariableValues`, the SAME cache the batch fills (panels fall back to `GetCachedVariableValue`, forms use `GetCachedVariableSnapshot`). **A380: ~1083 → ~530 defs, verified live, fully connects.** (2) **Resilience** — `SetupDataDefinitions` registers the bulk vars LAST, after the fixed/critical defs (AIRCRAFT_INFO/ATC/position/…), so detection can NEVER again be stranded by an overflow (it degrades gracefully). (3) **Guard + observability** — a 900 individual-def cap (skip+log past it) and a persistent `%APPDATA%\MSFSBlindAssist\logs\registration.log` recording the per-connect footprint, "[Detection] FULLY CONNECTED", and any "[CEILING]" `TOO_MANY_OBJECTS`.
- **PRACTICAL RULE NOW:** the A380 has ~470 vars of headroom; net additions are fine again. Adding a var as **Continuous+IsAnnounced costs 1 batch slot** (no individual def); **OnRequest costs 1 individual def**. Keep an eye on `registration.log` (`approxTotalDefs` should stay well under 1000). **Diagnostic if it ever recurs:** read `registration.log`; if `[CEILING]` appears, the connection hit 1000 — reduce continuous/OnRequest count or split to a second SimConnect connection (each gets its own 1000 budget). (Dead-end theories ruled out: it was NOT MobiFlight's cap, NOT bad stock-SimVar names like `INDICATED ALTITUDE:3` — those `NAME_UNRECOGNIZED` are pre-existing/harmless — and NOT the continuous-vs-OnRequest split; it was the raw TOTAL def count vs 1000.)
- **A32NX:** the strengthening is in the SHARED `SimConnectManager` — needs a live A32NX connect check (architecturally identical: fewer continuous vars, same cache reads).
- **`forceUpdate` works on batch-covered vars too.** Because a Continuous+IsAnnounced var has NO individual data def, a `RequestVariable(key, forceUpdate:true)` is delivered via the batch stream, not `ProcessIndividualVariableResponse`. `ProcessContinuousBatch` therefore consults `forceUpdateVariables` (same `lock` + `Remove` as the individual path) and fires `SimVarUpdated` even when the value is unchanged — without that, a force-read of an unchanged batch-covered value would silently no-op. Keep both paths honoring `forceUpdate`.

### Request id ranges

SimConnect treats a request issued under a request id already in use as a REPLACEMENT of the
earlier one, not a second, independent request — so every fixed range in this codebase must stay
clear of every other, and grepping the `DATA_REQUESTS` enum (`SimConnectManager.cs`) alone is not
enough to check that: several ranges live only as raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)` casts, invisible to a
search for a named enum member. From low to high:

- **2–14** — the fixed, individually-named `DATA_REQUESTS` one-shots (`REQUEST_FCU_VALUES`,
  `REQUEST_AIRCRAFT_INFO`, `REQUEST_AIRCRAFT_POSITION`, …), the five
  `REQUEST_CONTINUOUS_BATCH_n` (8–12) and `REQUEST_PANEL_BATCH`/`REQUEST_WEATHER_DATA` (13–14).
- **300–340** — the hotkey-readout one-shots (`REQUEST_HEADING`, …, `REQUEST_SQUAWK_CODE`,
  `REQUEST_LOCAL_TIME`/`REQUEST_ZULU_TIME`, `REQUEST_GSX_COUATL_STARTED` = 340) — two gaps in this
  band (324–328 and 330–337) are reserved by comment only, for hardcoded takeoff-assist/hand-fly
  and V-speed requests that never got their own enum member either.
- **341–348** — the camera read's rotating range (`REQUEST_CAMERA_VIEW` = 341,
  `SimConnectManager.CameraReadIdCount` = 8, `SimConnect/CameraReadWaiters.cs`): each
  instrument-view read goes out under the next of these eight ids, so an abandoned read's late
  reply can never complete the NEXT read — the original design shared ONE id for every camera
  read and paid for exactly that bug.
- **349** — `REQUEST_COM1_RADIO` (`DEF_COM1_RADIO`): COM 1's active and standby frequencies in
  one one-shot (`ReadCom1RadioAsync`), the first id past the camera's rotating range.
- **370–372** — hand-numbered too, ABOVE the 300–340 band and with no reserving comment in the
  enum at all: the dispatcher matches 370 (waypoint info) and 371/372 (hand fly's heading and
  vertical speed, issued in `SimConnectManager.Monitoring.cs`) by raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)` casts in
  `SimConnectManager.Dispatch.cs`.
- **500** — `REQUEST_AI_TRAFFIC`, TCAS's own ~150 nm sweep (`RequestAiTrafficData`).
- **505–508** — the hand-numbered guidance frames, matched by the dispatcher via a raw
  `(DATA_REQUESTS)` cast rather than a named enum member: 505 visual guidance, 506 takeoff
  assist, 507 taxi-guidance position, 508 manual-landing flare/rollout assist
  (`SimConnectManager.Monitoring.cs` issues them, `SimConnectManager.Dispatch.cs` reads them
  back). The enum has no member for any of the four.
- **600–607** — `REQUEST_GROUND_TRAFFIC`'s own rotating range
  (`SimConnectManager.GroundTrafficRequestIdCount` = 8): the ground-traffic monitor's
  small-radius sweeps (`RequestGroundTrafficData`), completing through the dedicated
  `GroundTrafficSweepCompleted` event — never TCAS's `REQUEST_AI_TRAFFIC`. It is not 501–508
  precisely because 505–508 sit there unnamed in the enum; a range chosen from the enum's own
  text alone would have collided with them and cancelled taxi guidance's own position stream.
- **700** — `REQUEST_ENUMERATE_INPUT_EVENTS`.
- **`FreshReadPolicy.SeedRequestIdOffset` (900,000) + a data-definition id** — the one-shot SEED
  read that primes the cache beside a SIM_FRAME own subscription, resolved back to its
  definition id by subtracting the offset (`FreshReadPolicy.DataDefinitionIdOf`). Sits between
  the definition-id range below and the fresh-read range above, clear of both.
- **`INDIVIDUAL_VARIABLE_BASE` (1000) upward** — one id per registered variable's data
  definition; the counter resets to 1000 on every connection and every aircraft switch, and a
  connection registers well under 2,000 defs (see the SimConnect data-definition ceiling above).
- **`SimConnectManager.FreshRequestIdBase` (1,000,000) upward** — `ReadFreshAsync`'s own
  per-read PERIOD.ONCE ids, chosen far enough above the largest data-definition id ever reached
  that the two ranges can never meet, so a fresh read's answer can always be told from an
  abandoned earlier read's.

Choosing a new fixed id means checking ALL of these, not just the enum: `GroundTrafficRequestIdTests`
pins that its 600–607 range clashes with none of the named `DATA_REQUESTS`/`DATA_DEFINITIONS`
values and none of the hand-numbered ones either — a hand-kept list (324–328, 330–337, 370–372,
505–508) and, so a FUTURE hand-numbered cast is caught too, a scan of every `*.cs` under
`MSFSBlindAssist/` for a raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)NNN` cast — and that none of 505–508 is also a named
enum value; a sweep planned at 501–508 during design, before that check existed, would have
replaced taxi guidance's own 507 position stream mid-flight.

### MobiFlightWasmModule
**File:** `SimConnect/MobiFlightWasmModule.cs`

- Handles H-variable communication through MobiFlight WASM module
- Implements automatic press/release mechanism for button interactions
- Provides fallback operation when registration times out
- Reusable for any panel requiring H-variable support

### `SimConnectManager.SetLVar` — GLOBAL MobiFlight calc-path routing (2026-06)

**An L:var write that reaches `SetLVar` is routed through the MobiFlight calculator path (`ExecuteCalculatorCode("{v} (>L:{var})")`) once that path is verified** — instead of the native `AddToDataDefinition` + `SetDataOnSimObject` write (which is unreliable for many add-on L:vars and silently reverts FBW vars a frame later). The routing lives in `SetLVar` (`SimConnect/SimConnectManager.EventSend.cs`) and is gated:
- **`CalcPathVerified`** must be true (the end-to-end nonce probe — `IsMobiFlightConnected` is true even with NO WASM module installed, so it must never gate writes) — otherwise it falls through to the data-def write so users without the WASM module still work; FBW installs verify within ~3 s of detection. Only an aircraft whose definition registers the probe target `MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` can verify: the FBW A320 and A380, the Headwind A330 by inheritance, and the TFDi MD-11 (`CalcPathProbeOptInTests`). MainForm concludes every other profile unverified at once. The verdict belongs to the connection, and a VERIFIED one is kept across an aircraft switch (`ArmBridgeProbe`, `CalcPathVerdict.ShouldRearmOnAircraftSwitch`, MD11-16): an aircraft that registers no probe target gets the calculator path only when one that does was loaded earlier on the same connection, and the data-def write otherwise.
- **Plain L:var names only** — a name containing a **space or colon** is left on the data-def path. Stock SimVar names have that shape (`TRANSPONDER STATE:1`, `INTERACTIVE POINT OPEN:0`), but the shape alone does not make a name a stock SimVar (VAR-2): add-on L:vars can be colon-indexed, and the HS787 passes `B787_IRS_Knob_State:1` to `SetLVar`, so it gets the data-def write. For such an L:var that route is unmeasured (SIM-12).

**So "with MobiFlight connected, does everything use the calc path except PMDG?" — no. The route depends on the verdict, not on MobiFlight being connected, and PMDG does call `SetLVar`. The precise scope:**
- **Routed through the calc path once verified:** every plain-L:var write that reaches `SetLVar` — panel combos/buttons (MainForm's `if (!handled) SetLVar(...)` fallbacks in `MainForm.PanelBuilder.cs`) and every aircraft def's own `SetLVar(key,value)` calls. In practice that is the probe registrants above, and any other aircraft only while a VERIFIED verdict carried over from one of them stands; otherwise these writes take the data-def path: the Fenix combos (the Fenix registers no probe target), the HS787's plain-named `XMLVAR_*` controls (fire handles, bleed isolation, crossfeed, standby power, baro STD, the autopilot mode flags), the PMDG 737's cabin, comfort and soundpack L:vars, and the PMDG 777's cockpit door. The FBW per-prefix catch-alls call `ExecuteCalculatorCode` themselves, unconditionally (VAR-3).
- **NOT routed (use their own mechanism regardless of MobiFlight):** **PMDG** cockpit controls (CDA `SetClientData`/`SendPMDGEvent`; only the L:var extras named above go through `SetLVar`), **K-events** (`SendEvent`/`TransmitClientEvent`), **H-events**, and **stock SimVars** (space/colon names, left on data-def). The HS787's K/H-event controls are unaffected too, and its colon-indexed L:var writes always take the data-def write (above).

**`SendEvent` H:/dotted calc-path gate + pre-connection queue.** The H:/dotted FBW event classes (e.g. `H:A32NX_CHRONO_RST`, `A32NX.FCU_AP_1_PUSH`) prefer the MobiFlight calc path. `SendEvent` splits them: **H: events** go to the MobiFlight channel whenever `IsMobiFlightConnected` (queued during the brief connect window — they have no other transport on any branch). **Dotted events** prefer the calc path only once **`CalcPathVerified`** (except the A380's `A32NX.FCU_*` events, which go to it at once and never wait — SIM-10, `IsFbwFcuEvent`); while the probe is still running they are queued in the bounded `pendingCalcEvents` (cap `MaxPendingCalcEvents = 64`), then flushed via calc on `MarkCalcPathVerified` or via the legacy `MapClientEventToSimEvent` + `TransmitClientEvent` transport on `MarkCalcPathProbeConcluded` (module absent, or an aircraft whose definition does not register the probe target `MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` — MainForm concludes immediately and silently for those; the FBW defs, the Headwind A330 by inheritance and the TFDi MD-11 register it and get the spoken verdict). The queue is cleared on MobiFlight teardown so events never carry across a disconnect/aircraft swap. `FireCalcEvent` is the shared single-event dispatcher used by both the live path and the flush.

**Catch-all standardization across aircraft — the verdict (verified, do NOT "fix" the Fenix):** the per-control explicit cases in `FenixA320Definition.HandleUIVariableSet` are **fine, not a gap**. MainForm ALREADY provides the effective catch-all: when `HandleUIVariableSet` returns false, the L:var combo and button paths call `SetLVar(varDef.Name, value)` (for the Fenix, which registers no probe target, that is the data-def write unless a VERIFIED verdict carried over; see above). So a plain Fenix L:var combo works with NO explicit case at all. The explicit Fenix cases that *matter* are the ones doing MORE than a plain write — button transitions (`ExecuteButtonTransition`, 0→1 pulse), COM frequency (validate + Hz + `SendEvent`), and encoder increment/decrement counters — and those **cannot** be replaced by a blanket `SetLVar` catch-all without breaking. A single cross-aircraft catch-all is impossible: **PMDG** writes its cockpit controls without L:vars (CDA struct offsets, inversions, momentary params), so a string-keyed `SetLVar` catch-all is meaningless for it, and the **HS787** drives many of its controls through K/H-event tables a `SetLVar` catch-all cannot replace; only its plain-named `XMLVAR_*` controls are ordinary L:var writes. The standard already exists at the MainForm `SetLVar`-fallback layer; each def only adds explicit cases for non-plain-write controls.

**RPN number formatting must be invariant fixed-point** — `value.ToString("0.################", InvariantCulture)` (or `"0.###"`-style) — NEVER default `{0}` formatting or `$"{double}"` interpolation: the former emits scientific notation for small/large magnitudes (`1E-05`) and the latter uses CurrentCulture (`87,5` on comma-decimal locales); the MSFS RPN parser rejects both. Same rule for every `ExecuteCalculatorCode` call that embeds a computed double (the A380 temp-selector was bitten).

## Multi-Aircraft Support Architecture

The application supports multiple aircraft through an abstraction layer added in 2025.

### IAircraftDefinition Interface
**File:** `Aircraft/IAircraftDefinition.cs`

Defines the contract all aircraft implementations must follow:

**Core methods:**
- `GetVariables()`: Returns all simulator variables for the aircraft
- `GetPanelStructure()`: Defines section/panel hierarchy for UI navigation
- `GetPanelControls()`: **Public API** - Returns cached panel controls dictionary (provided by BaseAircraftDefinition)
- `GetPanelDisplayVariables()`: Display-only variables (silent updates)
- `GetButtonStateMapping()`: Maps button events to state variables for announcements
- `HandleHotkeyAction()`: Handles aircraft-specific hotkey actions (returns bool if handled)
- `ProcessSimVarUpdate()`: Processes aircraft-specific variable updates before generic handling (returns bool if fully processed)

**FCU control type methods:**
- `GetAltitudeControlType()`, `GetHeadingControlType()`, etc.
- Returns `FCUControlType.SetValue` (direct value input) or `FCUControlType.IncrementDecrement` (INC/DEC buttons)

**FCU/MCP request methods (added 2025 - aircraft-specific):**
- `RequestFCUHeading()`, `RequestFCUSpeed()`, `RequestFCUAltitude()`, `RequestFCUVerticalSpeed()`
- Aircraft without FCU/MCP use default (do-nothing) implementations from BaseAircraftDefinition
- Each aircraft implements these with its own variable names

**Display monitoring methods (added 2025 - aircraft-specific):**
- `StartDisplayMonitoring()`, `StopDisplayMonitoring()`
- For ECAM (Airbus), EICAS (Boeing), or other display systems
- Aircraft without displays use default (do-nothing) implementations from BaseAircraftDefinition

**Aircraft metadata:**
- `AircraftName` (display)
- `AircraftCode` (settings persistence)

### BaseAircraftDefinition
**File:** `Aircraft/BaseAircraftDefinition.cs`

**Recommended base class for new aircraft** - provides default implementations, performance optimizations, and reusable patterns.

**Key features:**
- `GetHotkeyVariableMap()`: Override to map hotkey actions to SimConnect event names (simple mappings)
- `HandleHotkeyAction()`: Default implementation routes to variable map, override for complex behavior
- `ShowFCUInputDialog()`: Helper method for standard FCU value input dialogs

**Performance optimization (Panel Controls Caching):**
- `GetPanelControls()`: Concrete method with lazy-initialized caching (implements interface method)
- `BuildPanelControls()`: **Protected abstract** - override this in aircraft implementations to define panel structure
- **How it works**: First call to `GetPanelControls()` invokes `BuildPanelControls()` and caches result. Subsequent calls return cached dictionary.
- **Why**: Prevents recreating large panel control dictionaries (12,000+ lines for Fenix A320) on every access
- **Impact**: Eliminates panel navigation lag and screen reader responsiveness issues
- Automatic button state announcements for mapped hotkey actions

**When to use:** Inherit from this instead of implementing `IAircraftDefinition` directly

**Benefits:** Less boilerplate code, consistent hotkey patterns, reusable dialog logic

### Advanced: SimConnect Internals for Aircraft Implementations

For custom data requests beyond the public API, aircraft definitions can access SimConnect internals:

- `simConnectMgr.SimConnectInstance` (internal): Direct access to underlying SimConnect instance
- `DATA_REQUESTS` / `DATA_DEFINITIONS` (internal enums): For custom data definition IDs
- `RequestSingleValue(int id, string simVarName, string units, string varName)` (internal): Helper for single-value requests

**When to use:** Aircraft-specific request methods with custom structs (e.g., FCUValueWithStatus, WaypointInfo) - see FlyByWireA320Definition.cs:3868-4272

## Aircraft-Specific FCU and Display Systems

**Refactored in 2025:** FCU (Flight Control Unit) logic moved from SimConnectManager to individual aircraft definitions. This allows different aircraft to have completely different FCU implementations with their own variable names.

> **DOM-based glass cockpits (FBW A32NX/A380X and any Coherent GT aircraft).** When a display's content lives in a rendered web view rather than SimVars (the FBW MCDU/MFD, flyPad EFB, SD/EWD/ND/PFD/ISIS), it is read and driven through the **MSFS Coherent GT remote debugger**, not the SimVar path. The transport, the in-page agents (`Resources/coherent-*-agent.js`), the C# clients (`CoherentDebuggerClient` / `CoherentEFBClient` / `CoherentEWDClient` / `CoherentDisplayClient`), and the dev tooling are all documented in the **[Developer Tooling Guide](tooling.md)** — including **[§9 "Adaptability to other aircraft"](tooling.md)**, which explains which pieces are reusable for a new aircraft (transport + generic scrape core: universal; selectors/navigation/input: re-derive) and how. Crash diagnosis for the WebView2/Coherent layer is in [§8](tooling.md).

### Display Monitoring Architecture

Display monitoring (ECAM, EICAS, etc.) remains aircraft-specific within SimConnectManager using variable name pattern matching. This design is safe because:

- Different aircraft use different variable names (e.g., FlyByWire uses `A32NX_Ewd_LOWER_*`, Fenix might use `S_ECAM_*`)
- Pattern matching checks only trigger for exact variable name matches
- If an aircraft doesn't define those variables, the hardcoded checks never execute
- Each aircraft's warning/caution announcements work via the continuous monitoring system

### Why This Refactoring Was Needed

- Previous design hardcoded A320-specific FCU variables in SimConnectManager
- Made it impossible to add other aircraft with different FCU implementations
- Even different A320 addons (FlyByWire vs Fenix vs PMDG) need different variable names
- Each manufacturer implements FCU differently (Airbus FCU vs Boeing MCP)

### New Architecture

- FCU request methods are now part of the `IAircraftDefinition` interface
- Each aircraft implements its own FCU methods with aircraft-specific variable names
- Aircraft without FCU/MCP use default (do-nothing) implementations from BaseAircraftDefinition
- Display monitoring uses variable name checks in SimConnectManager (safe for multi-aircraft)

### Example: Same Hotkey, Different Variables

When user presses `]` then `Shift+H` to read FCU heading:

```csharp
// FlyByWire A320 Implementation
public override void RequestFCUHeading(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
{
    if (simConnect.IsConnected)
    {
        simConnect.RequestSingleValue(300, "L:A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_HDG_TRK_VALUE", "number", "FCU_HEADING");
    }
}

// Fenix A320 Implementation (hypothetical)
public override void RequestFCUHeading(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
{
    if (simConnect.IsConnected)
    {
        simConnect.RequestSingleValue(300, "L:S_FCU_HEADING", "number", "FCU_HEADING");  // Different variable
    }
}

// Boeing 737 Implementation (hypothetical)
public override void RequestFCUHeading(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
{
    if (simConnect.IsConnected)
    {
        simConnect.RequestSingleValue(300, "L:B737_MCP_HDG", "number", "FCU_HEADING");  // MCP instead of FCU
    }
}

// Cessna 172 Implementation
// Uses default implementation (does nothing - no FCU on light aircraft)
```

### Implementing FCU Methods in Your Aircraft

**1. Override the request methods** in your aircraft definition:

```csharp
public class YourAircraftDefinition : BaseAircraftDefinition
{
    public override void RequestFCUHeading(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
    {
        if (simConnect.IsConnected)
        {
            try
            {
                // Use aircraft-specific variable name
                simConnect.RequestSingleValue(300, "YOUR_HEADING_VAR", "number", "FCU_HEADING");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Log.Error("Aircraft", $"Error requesting FCU heading: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }

    // Similar implementations for RequestFCUSpeed, RequestFCUAltitude, RequestFCUVerticalSpeed
}
```

**2. For aircraft without FCU** - Don't override, use default implementation:

```csharp
public class Cessna172Definition : BaseAircraftDefinition
{
    // No FCU methods overridden - defaults do nothing
    // Hotkeys will work for other aircraft but be silent for this one
}
```

### Display Monitoring Pattern

Same pattern applies to display systems (ECAM, EICAS, etc.):

```csharp
// A320 with ECAM
public override void StartDisplayMonitoring(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect)
{
    // Start requesting A320 ECAM variables
    if (ecamMonitoringActive) return;
    ecamMonitoringActive = true;
    // ... request ECAM memo variables
}

// Boeing 737 with EICAS
public override void StartDisplayMonitoring(SimConnect.SimConnectManager simConnect)
{
    // Start requesting B737 EICAS variables
    if (eicastMonitoringActive) return;
    eicastMonitoringActive = true;
    // ... request EICAS variables
}
```

## Aircraft-Specific Variable Processing

**Added in 2025:** The `ProcessSimVarUpdate()` method allows aircraft to implement custom variable processing logic before MainForm's generic handling.

### Why This Method Is Needed

- Some aircraft have complex displays that require combining multiple variables (e.g., A320 FCU displays show value + managed mode)
- Different aircraft interpret the same variable types differently
- Allows aircraft to intercept and process variables before generic announcements

### Method Signature

```csharp
bool ProcessSimVarUpdate(string varName, double value, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
```

### Return Value

- `true`: Variable was fully processed by aircraft, no further generic processing needed
- `false`: Continue with generic processing in MainForm (display updates, button state announcements, etc.)

### When to Use

- Combining multiple related variables (FCU value + managed mode status)
- Mode-dependent variable interpretation (VS vs FPA mode)
- Aircraft-specific state machine logic
- Custom announcement formatting for specific variables

### Example: A320 FCU Display Combining

The A320 FCU displays require combining a value variable with a managed mode status:

```csharp
public override bool ProcessSimVarUpdate(string varName, double value, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
{
    // Heading display combines HDG value + managed status
    if (varName == "A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_HDG_TRK_VALUE")
    {
        // Only intercept if actively requesting heading readout
        if (!isRequestingHeading)
            return false; // Let MainForm handle normally

        // Store value, wait for managed status variable
        headingValue = value;
        headingValueReceived = true;

        // If we have both pieces, announce combined result
        if (headingManagedReceived)
        {
            string managedText = headingManaged == 1 ? "managed" : "selected";
            announcer.AnnounceImmediate($"Heading {headingValue:000} {managedText}");
            return true; // Fully processed, no further handling
        }

        return false; // Waiting for other variable
    }

    if (varName == "A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_HDG_TRK_MANAGED")
    {
        // Similar logic for managed status...
    }

    // Not an FCU variable we're tracking
    return false; // Let MainForm handle generically
}
```

### For Aircraft Without Complex Processing

Most aircraft can use the default implementation from `BaseAircraftDefinition`:

```csharp
// BaseAircraftDefinition provides this default:
public virtual bool ProcessSimVarUpdate(string varName, double value, ScreenReaderAnnouncer announcer)
{
    return false; // No special processing, let MainForm handle
}
```

### Migration Notes

The following changes were made to support this architecture:

**Removed from SimConnectManager.cs:**
- Hardcoded A320 FCU variable registration in `SetupDataDefinitions()` (lines 331-339)
- `RequestFCUHeading()`, `RequestFCUSpeed()`, `RequestFCUAltitude()`, `RequestFCUValues()` methods

**Kept in SimConnectManager.cs (safe for multi-aircraft):**
- A320-specific ECAM variable handling (uses variable name pattern matching - only triggers for A32NX variables)
- A320-specific fuel/payload requests (only called from A32NX-specific forms)

**Made public in SimConnectManager.cs:**
- `RequestSingleValue()` method (was internal) - allows aircraft definitions to request custom variables

**Added to IAircraftDefinition interface:**
- `RequestFCUHeading()`, `RequestFCUSpeed()`, `RequestFCUAltitude()`, `RequestFCUVerticalSpeed()`
- `StartDisplayMonitoring()`, `StopDisplayMonitoring()`
- `ProcessSimVarUpdate()` - Aircraft-specific variable processing before generic handling

**Added to BaseAircraftDefinition:**
- Default (do-nothing) implementations for all FCU and display methods
- Default `ProcessSimVarUpdate()` implementation (returns false for generic processing)

**Changed in MainForm.cs:**
- Replaced hardcoded A320 type check with `currentAircraft.ProcessSimVarUpdate()` call
- Now aircraft-agnostic - works for any aircraft implementation

## FlyByWireA320Definition

**File:** `Aircraft/FlyByWireA320Definition.cs`

Complete A320 aircraft implementation:
- Contains 367 variable definitions organized by system
- Defines 24 panels across 4 sections (Overhead Forward, Glareshield, Instrument, Pedestal)
- All FCU controls use `SetValue` type (direct value entry)
- 27 button-to-state mappings for automatic announcements
- **Serves as reference implementation** for adding new aircraft

## PMDG737Definition

**File:** `Aircraft/PMDG737Definition.cs`

PMDG 737-800 NG3 aircraft implementation:
- Uses CDA (Client Data Area) via `PMDG_NG3_Data` / `PMDG_NG3_Control` / `PMDG_NG3_CDU_0/1` structs
- Two CDUs (Captain = 0, F/O = 1); no observer CDU
- MCP value entry via dialogs (Shift+H / Shift+S / Shift+A / Shift+V) — no FPA mode
- See [pmdg-737.md](pmdg-737.md) for SDK gotchas

## Dynamic Aircraft Selection System

- `MainForm.currentAircraft`: Holds active aircraft instance
- `SimConnectManager.CurrentAircraft`: Property for variable access
- `PFDForm.CurrentAircraft`: Property for PFD-specific variable access
- Aircraft menu: User-selectable aircraft from "Aircraft" menu
- Settings persistence: `UserSettings.LastAircraft` remembers selection
- Runtime switching: `SwitchAircraft()` method rebuilds UI with new aircraft definition

## Aircraft-Specific Display Forms Organization

**Added in 2025:** The application organizes aircraft-specific display windows into dedicated subfolders to support multiple aircraft without code conflicts.

### Design Philosophy

- Each aircraft has its own display forms (NOT reusable across aircraft)
- Forms contain hardcoded variable names specific to that aircraft
- Forms are organized in subfolders matching the Aircraft/ folder structure
- Capability interfaces control menu visibility for aircraft-specific features

### IAircraftCapabilities Interfaces

**File:** `Aircraft/IAircraftCapabilities.cs`

Marker interfaces (no methods) used for type checking with the `is` operator:

- `ISupportsECAM`: Aircraft has ECAM display system (e.g., A320)
- `ISupportsNavigationDisplay`: Aircraft has dedicated ND/EFIS window
- `ISupportsPFDDisplay`: Aircraft has dedicated PFD window

### Forms Folder Structure

```
Forms/
├── FlyByWireA320/                  # FBW A32NX forms (MCDU, monitor manager)
├── FBWA320/                        # FBW A32NX FCU value-entry windows (Speed/Heading/Altitude/VS/AP/Baro)
├── FBWA380/                        # FBW A380X forms (FCU windows, MCDU/MFD, flyPad EFB, RMP, OANS, ECL, monitor manager, ...)
├── FenixA320/                      # Fenix A320 forms
├── PMDG737/  PMDG777/  PMDGEFB/    # PMDG forms + the shared accessible EFB
├── HS787/                          # HorizonSim 787 FMC form
├── RunwayTeleportForm.cs           # Universal (all aircraft)
├── GateTeleportForm.cs             # Universal (all aircraft)
├── AnnouncementSettingsForm.cs     # Universal (all aircraft)
├── FbwEwdWindow.cs                 # FBW E/WD pop-out window (A32NX + A380X)
├── WeatherRadarForm.cs             # Weather radar, SIGMETs, winds aloft
└── TcasForm.cs                     # TCAS traffic display
```

> **Note on the FlyByWire jets:** the A32NX and A380X no longer have dedicated PFD / ND / ECAM / STATUS / ISIS display *windows* — those forms were removed. Their values are read from the accessible status-box **panels** (Sections/Panels tree); the one exception is the **E/WD**, which keeps a pop-out window (`FbwEwdWindow`, `Alt`+`E`). The window-based display pattern below still applies to the Fenix and PMDG aircraft.

### Namespace Convention

- Aircraft-specific forms live in a per-aircraft subfolder and matching namespace, e.g. `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.FlyByWireA320`, `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.FBWA380`, `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.FenixA320`, `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.PMDG777`
- Future aircraft: add a new subfolder, e.g. `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.B737`
- Universal forms: `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms`

### Menu Visibility Control

The `UpdateAircraftSpecificMenuItems()` method in MainForm.cs controls which menu items are visible based on aircraft capabilities:

```csharp
private void UpdateAircraftSpecificMenuItems()
{
    // Control visibility based on aircraft capabilities
    navigationDisplayMenuItem.Visible = currentAircraft is ISupportsNavigationDisplay;
    pfdMenuItem.Visible = currentAircraft is ISupportsPFDDisplay;
    ecamDisplayMenuItem.Visible = currentAircraft is ISupportsECAM;
    statusDisplayMenuItem.Visible = currentAircraft is ISupportsECAM;
    fuelPayloadMenuItem.Visible = currentAircraft is ISupportsECAM;
}
```

This method is called automatically when the user switches aircraft via the Aircraft menu.

### Adding Display Forms for New Aircraft

**1. Create capability interfaces if needed** (in `IAircraftCapabilities.cs`):

```csharp
public interface ISupportsB737EFIS { }
public interface ISupportsB737FMC { }
```

**2. Create subfolder** for your aircraft:

```
Forms/B737/
```

**3. Create aircraft-specific forms** with namespace `MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.B737`:

```csharp
namespace MSFSBlindAssist.Forms.B737;

public partial class EFISForm : Form
{
    // Hardcode B737-specific variable names
    const string MCP_HEADING_VAR = "B737_MCP_HDG";
    // ... etc
}
```

**4. Implement capability interfaces** in your aircraft definition:

```csharp
public class Boeing737Definition : BaseAircraftDefinition,
    ISupportsB737EFIS,
    ISupportsB737FMC
{
    // ... implementation
}
```

**5. Add menu items** in `MainForm.Designer.cs` and update `UpdateAircraftSpecificMenuItems()` to control visibility.

### Why Forms Are NOT Reusable

- A320 ECAM vs B737 EICAS have completely different variable sets
- Display layouts and data formats differ between aircraft
- Each aircraft has unique systems and configurations
- Attempting to make generic forms would create unmaintainable complexity

### Git History Preservation

When moving existing forms to subfolders, use `git mv` to preserve commit history:

```bash
git mv MSFSBlindAssist/Forms/SomeForm.cs MSFSBlindAssist/Forms/B737/SomeForm.cs
```

## Other Core Components

### SimVarDefinitions
**File:** `SimConnect/SimVarDefinitions.cs`

**NOTE: Now contains ONLY base types - no aircraft-specific data**

- Defines enums: `SimVarType` (LVar, Event, SimVar, HVar), `UpdateFrequency` (Never, OnRequest, Continuous)
- Defines `SimVarDefinition` class structure with properties
- Aircraft-specific variable dictionaries have been moved to aircraft definition classes
- **To add variables**: Edit the appropriate aircraft definition class (e.g., `FlyByWireA320Definition.cs`), NOT this file

### SimVarMonitor
**File:** `SimConnect/SimVarMonitor.cs`

- Tracks variable changes for automatic announcements
- Generic change detection system for all variables
- Manages state change detection and notification

### ScreenReaderAnnouncer
**File:** `Accessibility/ScreenReaderAnnouncer.cs`

Multi-method screen reader communication with dual approach:
- NVDA direct support via NvdaControllerWrapper
- Universal screen reader support via TolkWrapper (JAWS, Window-Eyes, etc.)
- Configurable announcement modes (ScreenReader vs SAPI)
- Settings persistence for announcement preferences
- Fallback SAPI TTS when screen readers unavailable

### HotkeyManager
**File:** `Hotkeys/HotkeyManager.cs`

Dual-mode hotkey system:
- Read mode: `]` key activation for value readouts
- Input mode: `[` key activation for teleport and other future functions
- Supports FCU value readouts (heading, speed, altitude, VS, etc.)
- Runway and gate teleport hotkeys (Shift+R, Shift+G)
- Global hotkey registration for background operation

### AccessiblePanel
**File:** `Controls/AccessiblePanel.cs`

- Custom Windows Forms control optimized for screen reader navigation
- Implements three-level navigation: Sections → Panels → Controls

### NavdataReaderBuilder
**File:** `Database/NavdataReaderBuilder.cs`

- Builds the airport database with the navdatareader command-line tool, for FS2020 and FS2024
- Extracts airport, runway, and parking spot data
- Builds searchable SQLite database for teleport functionality

### TeleportForms
**Files:** `Forms/RunwayTeleportForm.cs`, `Forms/GateTeleportForm.cs`

- Accessible dialog forms for selecting teleport destinations
- ICAO code input with autocomplete runway/gate selection
- Integration with SimConnect for aircraft positioning

### Access GSX subsystem
**Files:** `Services/GsxService.cs`, `Forms/AccessGSXForm.cs`, `Forms/GsxSettingsForm.cs`

- Accessible wrapper for GSX Ground Services Pro menu and tooltip output
- `GsxService` tracks menu state, tooltip text, active services, settings metadata, invoices/receipts, and announcement throttling
- `AccessGSXForm` exposes status, menu, tooltip, active-service selection, `F5` menu open, option keys, `C` settings, and `Esc` hide
- `GsxSettingsForm` renders GSX settings as standard Windows controls and persists changed values back to GSX configuration
- Background tooltip announcements are controlled by `UserSettings.GsxBackgroundMonitoring`

See [Access GSX](gsx.md) for the full reference.

### TaxiGuidance subsystem
**Files:** `Services/TaxiGuidanceManager.cs`, `Services/TaxiSteeringTone.cs`, `Navigation/TaxiGraph.cs`, `Navigation/TaxiRouter.cs`, `Database/Models/TaxiPath.cs` + `TaxiNode.cs` + `TaxiRoute.cs` + `StartPosition.cs`, `Forms/TaxiAssistForm.cs`, `Forms/Settings/TaxiGuidancePanel.cs`

- Turn-by-turn taxi assistance using the navdatareader `taxi_path` / `start` / `parking` tables
- `TaxiGraph` merges path endpoints within ~1 m into shared nodes, indexes edges by taxiway name
- `TaxiRouter` performs ATC-constrained A*: the route **must** follow the taxiway sequence the user entered, falling back to shortest path only on disconnected inputs
- `TaxiGuidanceManager` drives the state machine (`Inactive → RouteLoaded → Taxiing → HoldShort → LiningUp → Arrived`), fed by SimConnect position updates via `UpdatePosition()`
- `TaxiSteeringTone` provides a stereo-panned audio steering cue — silent when on-track, pans toward the correction direction. Hysteresis (3° / 6°) + 400 ms min sustain + 1-pole low-pass on heading error kill jitter-induced flapping
- Integrates with takeoff assist: when the taxi reaches `LiningUp` on a runway and the aircraft has arrived, a reference is exposed via `TryGetRunwayLineupReference()`; MainForm seeds `TakeoffAssistManager` **only** when it isn't already configured (the teleport-dialog path always wins if used first)
- Universal airport support: no hardcoded taxiway / parking / runway names; everything comes from the user's DB

See [Taxi Guidance](taxi-guidance.md) for the full reference.

### TaxiAugment subsystem (Phase 5)
**Files:** `Services/TaxiAugment/AugmentingAirportDataProvider.cs`, `OsmTaxiSource.cs`, `XplaneAptDatSource.cs`, `TaxiDataMerger.cs`, `TaxiDataCache.cs`, `AirportTaxiData.cs`

- **Decorator pattern** on `IAirportDataProvider`: `AugmentingAirportDataProvider` wraps the `LittleNavMapProvider` returned by `DatabaseSelector.SelectProvider()` and is transparent to all downstream consumers (`TaxiGraph`, `TaxiGuidanceManager`, etc.)
- `GetTaxiPaths(icao)` enriches unnamed navdata segments with real-world taxiway names from OSM (Overpass API) and the X-Plane apt.dat gateway via geometric midpoint + bearing matching
- `GetParkingSpots(icao)` calls the public `AugmentParking(icao, spots)`, which sets `spot.Aliases = GateAliasResolver.ResolveAliases(spot, online)` — matching by **IDENTITY, not distance**: the numbers must match and any letters must agree, so an alias only ever RE-LETTERS the same stand (bare `"51"` gains OSM's `"A51"`; `"N3"` gains the MARS `"N3A"` but never `"A3"`). A 150 m Haversine value is a sanity *backstop*, NOT the matcher. The earlier nearest-pair-within-50 m gate-NAME fill was **REMOVED 2026-06-23** — it corrupted gate identity at dense terminals (CYUL gate 15 adopted "Gate 11B" from an offset apt.dat ramp). Online data never sets a Name or position and never adds a selectable gate (anti-grass); X-Plane apt.dat supplies real gate numbers many navdata sets lack (CYYZ "Gate 131"). `AugmentParking` is **public** so the GSX gate path (which bypasses `GetParkingSpots`) gets the same aliases. An alias surfaces as a searchable label on the spot's ONE dropdown entry, never as an entry of its own — navdata name is always authoritative. Full rules: [taxi-guidance.md](taxi-guidance.md)
- Cache is **in-memory only** (`ConcurrentDictionary` + TTL, no disk) — fresh every session; departure/destination force-fresh, geofenced nearby airports ride the in-session cache
- Returns navdata immediately on a cache miss; background-fetches in `Task.Run` (fire-and-forget, in-flight deduplication via `HashSet<string> + lock`); raises `AirportDataUpdated` event on completion
- Name writeback is **by index on the original `TaxiPath` objects** — no rebuild, no field loss
- Wired in `MainForm` immediately after `DatabaseSelector.SelectProvider()`, guarded by `if (airportDataProvider != null)`
- Diagnostics: `%APPDATA%\MSFSBlindAssist\logs\taxi-augment.log`, written via `Utils/Logging/Log.Channel("taxi-augment")` (path resolved underneath by `AppLogs.PathFor`) — see CLAUDE.md [CORE-14]/[CORE-15] and the Diagnostic Logs background in [invariants/core.md](invariants/core.md) for the facade
- `Enabled` property (default `true`) wired to `UserSettings.TaxiAugmentEnabled` (in-dialog checkbox + ODbL / X-Plane attribution in Taxi Guidance Options); a "Refresh Taxiway Names" button force-fetches the nearby airport and announces the names-added count (`GetLastCoverage`)

See [Taxi Guidance — Taxi-Data Augmentation Pipeline](taxi-guidance.md#taxi-data-augmentation-pipeline-phase-5) for the full reference.

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Individual Variable System**: All 220+ variables are registered individually
   - Continuous: Variables monitored every second for announcements
   - OnRequest: Variables requested when panels open or hotkeys are pressed
   - Never: Write-only variables that don't need to be read

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses C# events for loose coupling between components

3. **Fallback Systems**: Multiple announcement methods ensure accessibility across different screen reader configurations

4. **Button State Mapping**: Unified mapping system tracks button events to their corresponding state variables for automatic announcements

5. **Dual Screen Reader Support**:
   - Primary: Direct NVDA integration via controller client
   - Secondary: Universal support through Tolk wrapper
   - Fallback: SAPI text-to-speech

6. **Configurable Accessibility**: User-selectable announcement modes with persistent settings
