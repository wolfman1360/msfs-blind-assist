# Core SimConnect and MainForm — rules in full

Each section is the complete text of one rule. Its one-line form, under the same ID, is in `.claude/rules/core-simconnect.md`, which Claude Code loads when it reads matching code. Background: [architecture.md](../architecture.md).
The text is verbatim from CLAUDE.md as of `1f37801a`; a trailing "→ doc" pointer is the original's. Cross-references such as "the bullet below", "above" or "under Core" point at CLAUDE.md's old single list, whose rules now live in several files: search `docs/invariants/` for the rule's key name to find it.

## SIM-1

- The SimConnect data-definition budget is 1000 per connection (resets per aircraft switch) — never register a var as BOTH an individual def AND a batch-covered def; a Continuous+IsAnnounced var must skip its individual registration and read from the shared batch cache. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-2

- `SetupDataDefinitions` must register bulk/batch vars LAST, after the fixed/critical defs (AIRCRAFT_INFO/ATC/position) — so a def-count overflow degrades gracefully instead of stranding aircraft detection. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-3

- Watch `registration.log`'s `approxTotalDefs` — never let a new var addition push a connection's total definitions near/over 1000 without splitting to a second SimConnect connection. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-4

- `RequestVariable(key, forceUpdate:true)` must also work for batch-covered (no-individual-def) vars — `ProcessContinuousBatch` must consult `forceUpdateVariables` too, or a forced re-read of an unchanged batch value silently no-ops. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-5

- `SimConnectManager.RequestVariable` may be called from ANY thread and must stay safe there: the MD-11's walks and read-backs reach `ReadFreshAsync` from thread-pool threads (`ConfigureAwait(false)` chains). The manager captures the UI thread's WinForms `SynchronizationContext` and thread id at construction (`UiThreadGate`; any other kind of context leaves the gate inert, because a context that runs its posts on a pool thread would re-post forever), and `RequestVariable` called off that thread POSTS itself there and re-checks the connection when it runs — a post refused at shutdown is dropped, never run inline. `FreshReadWaiters.WaitAsync` registers the waiter BEFORE invoking the issue callback, so a posted request loses nothing, and `continuousVariableIndexMap` is a `ConcurrentDictionary`. Never read that map or issue `RequestDataOnSimObject` from a pool thread directly. The CEVENT pump's calculator writes still run on the pump thread — `SendMFCommand` is a pure send with no shared state — a recorded residual, not a licence. → [md11.md](../md11.md)

## SIM-6

- Request ids 505–508 are the hand-numbered guidance frames (`(DATA_REQUESTS)505..508`: visual guidance, takeoff assist, taxi-guidance position, flare assist — `SimConnectManager.Monitoring.cs`/`Dispatch.cs`) and 600–607 are the ground-traffic sweeps' rotating range (`REQUEST_GROUND_TRAFFIC`, `GroundTrafficRequestIdCount`) — never assign an id in either range to anything else, and grep for raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)` casts before choosing a new one: SimConnect treats a request issued under an existing id as a REPLACEMENT, so a sweep planned at 501–508 would have cancelled taxi guidance's own position stream (the enum alone does not show those four; an earlier review missed them exactly that way). Pinned by `GroundTrafficRequestIdTests`, which also scans every `*.cs` under `MSFSBlindAssist/` for a raw `(DATA_REQUESTS)NNN` cast, so a future hand-numbered id is caught too. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-7

- A delivered value is a CHANGE (fires `SimVarUpdated`) only when it moves by more than its definition's `SimVarDefinition.ChangeTolerance`, or the shared `SimConnectManager.ChangeTolerance` (0.001) when that is null — ONE rule, `SimConnectManager.IsValueChange`, for both delivery paths. Widen it only for a var whose readers need a coarse line and whose ripple costs work: the MD-11's `MD11_DC_BUS_VOLTAGE` is 0.5 V (its power gate needs only the 20 V line, and each ripple re-composed every stateful row of the open panel once a second). The cache still takes every delivery, so a drift slower than the tolerance per sample never fires — never widen a var whose reader acts on a small cumulative change, and never one `Md11SeedGate` counts (it compares at the shared constant). → [md11.md](../md11.md)

## SIM-8

- The calc-path probe MUST report its verdict — `CalcPathVerdict.LogLine` on both outcomes, and `PilotWarning` spoken when an aircraft that registers the probe target (`MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` — the FBW defs, the Headwind A330 by inheritance, and the TFDi MD-11) concludes UNVERIFIED. MainForm's timer gates on THAT REGISTRATION, never on a type list: a type list is how the MD-11 — every control write a calculator-path CEVENT — sat outside the probe with no module and no warning, while every load logged a false `NOT available after 0 attempt(s)`. It reported NOTHING before, which is the sole reason a broken probe degraded every generic L:var write and dotted FBW event for ten weeks unnoticed. Never make the verdict silent again. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-9

- The `MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE` read-back LAGS ITS WRITE BY ONE ROUND (the data-def request is issued right after the calc write, so the sim answers with the pre-write value) — the match must accept the PREVIOUS nonce as well (`SimConnect.BridgeProbe.IsEcho`). Comparing only the current nonce misses by exactly one every round, and since each miss picks a fresh nonce the probe NEVER converges: measured live with the nonce past 861 having never once verified. The cost is silent and huge — `CalcPathVerified` stays false, so `SetLVar` falls back to the data-def write that is unreliable for FBW L:vars AND every dotted FBW event falls back to a transport the FCU ignores ("the FCU won't accept"). → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-10

- **A380** FCU events (`A32NX.FCU_*`) must NEVER wait on that probe (`SimConnectManager.IsFbwFcuEvent`) — the A380X FCU consumes them strictly as calculator K-events, so a probe false negative does not degrade them, it kills them. `FireFCUButton` always bypassed the gate by calling `ExecuteCalculatorCode` directly, which is exactly why the knob buttons worked while the combos silently did nothing — that inconsistency hid the fault. The predicate is gated on `AircraftCode == "FBW_A380"` and that half is load-bearing: the **A32NX shares the event NAMES** but is reached fine by `MapClientEventToSimEvent` + `TransmitClientEvent`, so applying the bypass there deletes a working fallback instead of rescuing a broken one — a pilot without the MobiFlight WASM module (a supported, degraded configuration, the one `CalcPathVerdict.PilotWarning` announces) would lose `FCU_HDG/SPD/ALT_SET`, the `FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_BARO_{SET,PUSH,PULL}` writes and every A320 FCU panel button outright. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-11

- `SetLVar`'s MobiFlight calc-path routing must gate on `CalcPathVerified`, never on bare `IsMobiFlightConnected` — that flag is true even with no WASM module installed. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-12

- A name containing a space or colon (e.g. `TRANSPONDER STATE:1`) is a stock SimVar shape and must stay on the data-def write path — never route it through the L:var calc path. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-13

- H: events must always go to the MobiFlight channel whenever `IsMobiFlightConnected`; dotted events must wait for `CalcPathVerified` (queued, bounded, flushed on verify or probe-conclude) — never fire a dotted event before the probe concludes. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-14

- The status-display auto-refresh repaint must be a LEADING-edge one-shot coalesce, never a restart-per-push trailing debounce — a trailing debounce starves under high-frequency PFD/ISIS streams (hand-fly posts per SIM_FRAME). → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-15

- `UpdateDisplayText` must always refresh `displayValues` from `GetCachedVariableValue` first — relying on stale cached `displayValues` alone goes stale for any def that returns `true` from `ProcessSimVarUpdate` (A32NX COM freqs, A380 EFIS baro, HS787 flight data all skip the generic write). → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-16

- The per-event "is this var in any panel display" gate must use the cached `GetDisplayVarNamesCached()` HashSet — never call a def's `GetPanelDisplayVariables()` per SimVar event; it rebuilds its whole dictionary on every call. → [architecture.md](../architecture.md)

## SIM-17

- Every calc-path event string must be unique per call — `SimConnectManager.BuildCalcEventCode` prefixes `{seq} 0 *` centrally, because MobiFlight dedups byte-identical consecutive commands and a TOGGLE fires the SAME event for on and off, so without it a control could be switched on and never off. The dedup keys on TEXT, not elapsed time: "presses are seconds apart" is NOT a mitigation. → [a380x.md](../a380x.md)
