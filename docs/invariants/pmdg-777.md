# PMDG 777 — rules in full

Each section is the complete text of one rule. Its one-line form, under the same ID, is in `.claude/rules/pmdg-777.md`, which Claude Code loads when it reads matching code. Background: [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md).
The text is verbatim from CLAUDE.md as of `1f37801a`; a trailing "→ doc" pointer is the original's. Cross-references such as "the bullet below", "above" or "under Core" point at CLAUDE.md's old single list, whose rules now live in several files: search `docs/invariants/` for the rule's key name to find it.

## P777-1

- Continuous knobs (brightness, temperature, EFIS baro/mins) cannot be controlled via the PMDG SDK event with a position parameter — do not add them to panels via that path (the cockpit-model-L:var-IS-the-input exception applies only to a few named knobs, e.g. shoulder heaters). → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-2

- Fuel control levers are the inverted exception — CDA parameter 1=Cutoff/0=Run, not the usual on/off convention. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-3

- Ground power switches (`ELEC_ExtPwr`) are momentary — always send parameter 1 regardless of target state. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-4

- The PMDG 777 foot-heater combo and the Boris Audio Works hydraulic-pump-model combo drive the SAME physical knob — only expose the Boris combo; do not re-add a separate foot-heater control. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-5

- Crew seats are NOT adjustable on the PMDG 777 — no event/struct field/L:var/animation exists; don't go hunting for seat-motion vars. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-6

- CDU buttons must send parameter 1 (pressed) via CDA — parameter 0 ALSO registers as a press, not a release, so never rely on 0 to mean "no press." → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

Corrected 2026-10-09: the rule said every CDU button goes through CDA, but FMCCOMM and HOLD do not. The CDA path (parameter 1, never released) opens the page on the first press, but the PMDG SDK will not re-trigger the same page key without a release edge, so after the pilot navigates away, pressing FMCCOMM or HOLD again is silently dead (no sound, the page never refreshes). That was issue #46; a CDA-only fix (commit f55d157) regressed it because it was verified only by opening the page once. Those two keys now send `TransmitClientEvent` with `MOUSE_FLAG_LEFTSINGLE` (0x20000000), a self-contained click each call; every other CDU key keeps the faster CDA path, where a stray double-press would double-enter text. Evidence: `PMDG777CDUForm.SendCDUKey` (`Forms/PMDG777/PMDG777CDUForm.cs`), the `FMCCOMM`/`HOLD` branch and its comment.

## P777-7

- The CDU array index convention is `0=Captain/1=F.O./2=Observer` for every crew-position array including CDU data areas — the dropdown is Left/Center/Right and needs the `DataCDUIndex` remap (`1→2, 2→1`); the event-prefix switch uses the raw dropdown index and must NOT be remapped. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-8

- `EVT_MCP_VS_SWITCH` is engage/disengage; `EVT_MCP_VS_FPA_SWITCH` is the VS↔FPA display toggle — the SDK names are misleading (confirmed only by live testing); don't swap them back based on the names. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-9

- PMDG-broadcast System Display reads must gate on `IPMDGDataManager.IsReady` — before the first CDA snapshot, `GetFieldValue` returns 0.0 for every field, which must render as `--`, never as "every door open"/"0 lb". → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-10

- MainForm's PMDG panel-populate loop must only force-read `Type == PMDGVar` controls — force-reading a non-PMDG control (e.g. an LVar combo) via `GetFieldValue` returns the "unknown field" 0.0 sentinel and silently resets it on every panel re-show. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-11

- The 777 autobrake selector has EIGHT detents including a DISARM at index 2 (`0 RTO / 1 OFF / 2 DISARM / 3 "1" / 4 "2" / 5 "3" / 6 "4" / 7 MAX AUTO`) — never harmonize it with the 737's six (RTO/OFF/1/2/3/MAX, no DISARM); dropping DISARM shifts every label above OFF one step and silently commands one setting lower than announced. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-12

- The emergency-exit light guard MUST be driven (`EVT_OH_EMER_EXIT_LIGHT_GUARD`, 0=closed/1=open; ARMED is the guard-closed position) — the old "opening the guard leaves the switch unusable" belief was wrong, and without the guard OFF/ON are unreachable. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-13

- The emergency-lights guard→switch 80 ms settle gap is load-bearing (the two writes use DIFFERENT transports — CDA vs TransmitClientEvent — and arrive out of order without it, forcing the pilot to pick the position twice) — never drop it to zero; and the sequence must stay SERIALIZED (`_emerLightsGate`, latest-selection-wins) and fired as a plain async local function, NEVER `Task.Run` (which would race `SimConnectManager.SendEvent`'s unlocked `eventIds` dictionary from a pool thread). → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-14

- `RequestVariable(key, forceUpdate: true)` is a NO-OP for any `PMDGVar` (CDA-broadcast, so in neither the data-def nor the continuous-batch map) — never use it to snap a PMDG combo back; that trick only works for the L:var-typed controls (e.g. the temp-knob variant guards). → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)

## P777-15

- **Speed-brake ARM is EXACT on the PMDG 737, the PMDG 777 and the iFly 737 MAX** (`PmdgLeverDetent.Tolerance`, 0.25) — never widen it back into the table's settle band. Measured 2026-09-30 with hydraulics pressurised: one step past ARM the PMDG spoilers are already 34 percent up (737 `L:switch_679_73X` 101, 777 `L:switch_498_a` 201), and the iFly's deploy in step with the lever from 34, so the old bands announced "Speed brake armed" over deployed speed brakes; past ARM speaks a percentage, never "0 percent", and the Control Stand combo seeds the nearest DEPLOYED detent, never "Armed" (`PmdgSpeedBrakeLever.NearestDetentValue`). The 777 lever must be read from `L:switch_498_a` (0-400), NEVER the SDK's `FCTL_Speedbrake_Lever` byte — a quarter of it, TRUNCATED, so 201-203 read exactly 50. Both PMDG levers ride the 1 Hz L-var batch with a 1500 ms settle, which must outlast one batch now that a lever between detents is spoken. → [pmdg-777.md](../pmdg-777.md)
