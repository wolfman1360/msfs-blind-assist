# FlyByWire A32NX and Fenix A320

> **Read this when:** working on the FlyByWire A32NX panels/MCDU, or the Fenix A320 (cockpit controls, monitor manager, momentary buttons).

### FlyByWire A32NX Panel Parity (Phase 3)

The A32NX panel set in `FlyByWireA320Definition.cs` is now at parity with the A380 (`FlyByWireA380Definition.cs`) — every A380 overhead/glareshield/pedestal/ground-services panel exists on the A320, with matching labels. Notes for future maintainers (all live-verified against the running A32NX via the SimConnect MCP calculator path):

- **EFIS is split Captain / First Officer.** The ND mode + range CONTROL is the FCU knob `A32NX_FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_EFIS_MODE/RANGE` — it drives the computed `A32NX_EFIS_{L,R}_ND_MODE/RANGE` DISPLAY output. The bare `A32NX_EFIS_*_ND_*`, `_OPTION` (CSTR/WPT/VORD/NDB/ARPT filter) and `_NAVAID_*_MODE` vars are computed outputs that REVERT a calc-path write (verified) → they stay read-only. The LS button: dev FBW REMOVED `A32NX_EFIS_{L,R}_LS_BUTTON_IS_ON` (the old "directly settable" verdict was the dead-var write-stick trap) — control = the registered input event `A32NX.FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_LS_PUSH`, state = `A32NX_FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_LS_LIGHT_ON`.
- **Anti-Ice:** the `XMLVAR_MOMENTARY_PUSH_OVHD_ANTIICE_*_PRESSED` vars are model press-animation flags that do NOT actuate (same as A380 #56). WING anti-ice = `A32NX_BUTTON_OVHD_ANTI_ICE_WING_POSITION` (the var the cockpit PB writes and the only input `WingAntiIcePushButton::read` takes). ⚠️ **CORRECTED** — this line used to say `A32NX_PNEU_WING_ANTI_ICE_SYSTEM_SELECTED` "holds in flight"; that was a mis-test, the var is a Rust per-frame OUTPUT and any write reverts within 2 s at any phase. `_SYSTEM_ON` is the read-only flowing status. The **A380 uses neither var** — it drives the stock `STRUCTURAL DEICE SWITCH`; never copy wing anti-ice wiring between the two airframes. ENG 1/2 anti-ice = the stock K-event `ANTI_ICE_SET_ENGn` (state from `ENG ANTI ICE:n`), routed in HandleUIVariableSet.
- **Thrust Levers (settable detents)** ported from the A380 (2 engines): synthetic `THROTTLE_ALL_DETENT` + `THROTTLE_{1,2}_DETENT` combos → `THROTTLEn_AXIS_SET_EX1` with the FBW default-calibration axis values (idle `-0.44` verified to snap to the A320 idle dead-zone). The synthetic `_DETENT` keys are EXCLUDED from the GetVariables auto-announce loop (no real L:var to monitor — the loop guard checks `!key.EndsWith("_DETENT")`); the live angle reads from `A32NX_AUTOTHRUST_TLA:n`.
- **Doors** = synthetic `A32NX_MSFSBA_DOOR_{0..5}` combos backed by `INTERACTIVE POINT OPEN:n` (the exit index maps 1:1 to the interactive point on the A32NX; 0-3 = passenger, 4-5 = cargo per `EXIT TYPE:n`), set toggles `TOGGLE_AIRCRAFT_EXIT:n`. The var is a 0..1 animation fraction → ProcessSimVarUpdate announces Open/Closed once per transition (>0.05) and TryGetDisplayOverride renders the state. **Ground Equipment** jetway/stairs are momentary Activate combos → stock `TOGGLE_JETWAY` / `TOGGLE_RAMPTRUCK` (the A320 has no clean state var like the A380's `A380X_GND_*`). The flyPad Ground page (Shift+T) stays the richer ground interface.
- **Audio Control Panel: REMOVED (2026-06 dev-source audit).** The `A32NX_RMP_{L,R}_VHF{n}_VOLUME` L:vars do NOT exist in dev FBW — the physical ACP is unmodeled (tooltip-only dummies in the cockpit XML). The old 5-step volume combos were dead writes and were deleted. If volume control is ever wanted, the only functional mechanism is the stock sim (`COM1/2/3_VOLUME_SET` / `COM VOLUME:n`).
- **Flaps-and-Brakes is intentionally NOT consolidated** on the A320 (it keeps the separate Flight Controls / Speed Brake / Parking Brake panels) — a deliberate divergence from the A380's "Flaps and Brakes".
- **COM radios (RMP panel) — stock events, auto-announced (2026-06).** The A32NX RMP drives the STOCK COM radios (its React panel writes `K:COM*_STBY_RADIO_SET_HZ` / reads the stock simvars), so — UNLIKE the A380 — the stock set + swap events work: live-verified `COM2_STBY_RADIO_SET_HZ` and `COM2_RADIO_SWAP` round-trip. The former separate "Radios" panel was MERGED into the **RMP** panel (frequency tuning IS the RMP on the A320); tab order is deliberate — per-radio **Set Standby**, **Set Active** (= set standby, 100 ms, swap — there is no direct active-set that keeps the RMP display honest), and **XFER** (swap) for COM1 + COM2 come FIRST after the panel list, the rarely-touched RMP power/mode switches last. Set logic lives in `FlyByWireA320Definition.HandleUIVariableSet` (index-aware: COM1 = un-numbered `COM_STBY_RADIO_SET_HZ`, COM2/3 = `COM{n}_STBY_RADIO_SET_HZ`), SILENT on success because **`COM_ACTIVE/STANDBY_FREQUENCY:1/2` are Continuous+IsAnnounced** and `ProcessSimVarUpdate` speaks the resulting change ("COM 1 active 121.500") — Fenix/A380 RMP parity, seeded silently on first sample, airband-gated (118–137 MHz) so unpowered junk caches silently, Ctrl+M-mutable. A swap therefore reads both the new active and new standby. `COM_TRANSMIT:1-3` are also monitored: "Transmitting on VHF n" on the rising edge only. The freq display fields render MHz via `TryGetDisplayOverride` (raw values are kHz) and refresh from the SimConnect cache fallback on panel open (the ProcessSimVarUpdate `return true` skips MainForm's displayValues sink — same idiom as the EFIS baro fields).
- **A380 Speed Brake** — a pedestal "Speed Brake" panel with a Retracted/Half/Full combo → `SPOILERS_SET` (0/8192/16383) + a Disarm/Arm combo → `SPOILERS_ARM_OFF/_ON`, and the handle auto-announced by 10% band. **The Retracted/Half/Full combo is LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-06-18):** `SPOILERS_SET` drives the FBW speed brake even though the stock `SPOILERS HANDLE POSITION` simvar stays 0 — read back the FBW L:var `A32NX_SPOILERS_HANDLE_POSITION` instead (8192→0.5, 16383→~1.0, 0→0). The Disarm/Arm combo (`SPOILERS_ARM_OFF/_ON`) is still unverified.
- **EWD on-demand read** is on BOTH jets via `ReadDisplayUpperECAM` (output mode, Alt+E), each opening the `FbwEwdWindow` pop-out. **Both are now DECODE-based — NO Coherent scrape in the A320 path.** The A320's `BuildEwdWindowTextAsync(sim)` decodes the upper E/WD from SimVars: thrust rating + the single `A32NX_AUTOTHRUST_THRUST_LIMIT` number (the A320 has NO per-engine THR% gauge, unlike the A380), per-engine N1 / N1-command / EGT / N2 / FF / state (2 engines, no N3), reversers, IDLE, and FOB (`A32NX_TOTAL_FUEL_QUANTITY` via `WeightUser`) — plus the ECAM memo/warning lines decoded from the `A32NX_Ewd_LOWER_*` SimVar codes via **`SimConnectManager.GetEcamLineRaw`** (the batch handler decodes those codes to `ecamStringData` strings and `continue`s PAST the numeric cache, so `GetCachedVariableValue` returns null for them — `GetEcamLineRaw` exposes the decoded text). The schematic engine row scraped as garbage ("XX XX"), and the Coherent scrape socket is a documented native-crash risk, so the **A320 scrape was REMOVED entirely** (the old `ReadEwdAloud` method + `_ewdScrapeClient` field are gone); a text placeholder shows when nothing decodes (displays unpowered). The SD page-0 box uses the same decode. **The A380 KEEPS its always-on `CoherentEWDClient` (`EwdMonitor`)** — but only because its newer architecture moved the sensed abnormal/failure PROCEDURES onto an in-process EventBus with NO SimVar (so they can ONLY be scraped); its normal memos decode the same way, and its SD box-scrape fallback goes THROUGH the one always-on monitor socket (never a second client). The A32NX (older FBW) publishes ALL its EWD message content — warnings + actions + memos — as the `Ewd_LOWER` codes, so it needs no scrape. The continuous EWD-line monitor still auto-announces new memos/warnings on both.
- **Autoflight (A/THR / LOC / APPR) is wired via the FBW input events** `A32NX.FCU_{ATHR,LOC,APPR}_PUSH` + `A32NX.FCU_ATHR_DISCONNECT_PUSH` (A380 A/THR also via stock `AUTO_THROTTLE_ARM`). These are registered FBW **input events** (source: `fbw-a380x/.../SimConnectInterface.cpp`), reached by MSFSBA's `SendEvent` — which routes DOTTED event names through the MobiFlight calc path (`{data} (>K:NAME)`), the shipping transport for all A32NX.* events (see the "SendEvent H:/dotted calc-path gate" section; an older note here claimed the calc K: form no-ops — the FCU events are live-verified through exactly that path). They won't arm on the ground, so ground testing is inconclusive but the wiring is source-correct. Both FCU panels expose engage + disengage + LOC + APPR.
- **Air-conditioning ZONE TEMP selectors** (5th-audit gap): Cockpit / Fwd Cabin / Aft Cabin are numeric °C inputs (`COND_*_TEMP_SET`) → `HandleUIVariableSet` converts to the `A32NX_OVHD_COND_{CKPT,FWD,AFT}_SELECTOR_KNOB` (0..300 ↔ 18-30 °C, live-verified). Actual zone temps `A32NX_COND_*_TEMP` read in the display. **APU AVAIL** (`A32NX_OVHD_APU_START_PB_IS_AVAILABLE`) is a read-only APU-panel field (not auto-announced — the EWD memo speaks it).
- **EFIS baro (altimeter) is per-side + silent on first detect.** Captain = `A32NX_FCU_LEFT_EIS_BARO_HPA` + `_EFIS_L_DISPLAY_BARO_VALUE_MODE`; First Officer = the `RIGHT`/`_R_` equivalents (announced with a "First Officer" prefix). BOTH the HPA and the value-MODE handlers **seed their cache silently on the first read** — otherwise each announced on first detect, which was the "altimeter spoken twice on start" bug. Brake "triple indicator" (`A32NX_HYD_BRAKE_{NORM,ALTN}_{LEFT,RIGHT}_PRESS` + `_ALTN_ACC_PRESS`) + Brakes Hot + GPWS Test were added for A380 parity.
- **Feature parity with the A380:** the A32NX now also has **rudder trim** (FCC display reads `A32NX_FAC_1_RUDDER_TRIM_POS`, an ARINC degrees word, positive = nose-Left, + a Reset combo firing `RUDDER_TRIM_RESET`) and **metric/imperial weight units** (gross-weight + fuel-info readouts follow the EFB `A32NX_EFB_USING_METRIC_UNIT` setting via `WeightUser(kg)`; the EFB "US Units" toggle, Shift+T → Settings, is the control — no separate hotkey). NOT ported (the A320 genuinely can't): **metric ALTITUDE / MTRS** (the real A320 has no MTRS button — A330+/A380 only; NOTE: dev FBW registers a metric-alt-toggle event on the A32NX, but it is INERT on the installed build — the L:var never moves and no consumer exists in any installed bundle, only the ISIS/EFB metric settings do — so it is deliberately NOT exposed, resolved 2026-06-12), and **BTV / OANS / ROW-ROP** (A380/A350 systems).
- **FCU value-entry windows ported (Ctrl+S/H/A/V/P/B).** The A32NX now has its own Fenix-style FCU windows (`Forms/FBWA320/FBWA320{Speed,Heading,Altitude,VS,Autopilot,Baro}Window` + shared `FBWA320FCUWindowBase`), mirroring the A380's — value entry + knob Push/Pull + mode toggles + spoken read-out, replacing the deleted single-field `ShowA320*InputDialog` / `ShowFBWBaroSetDialog`. Thin UI delegating to public `FlyByWireA320Definition` methods: `SetFCU{Heading,Speed,Altitude,VS}Value`, `FireFCUButton(evt)` (readback via an inline event→`RequestFCU*` switch — the A320 overrides `OnPanelButtonFiring` to arm the FCU echo before a panel button's event is sent, but `FireFCUButton` still runs its own readback switch rather than `OnPanelButtonFired`), `RequestFCU{Heading,Speed,Altitude,VS}Readout` (wrappers over the existing private `RequestFCU*WithStatus`/`RequestFCUVerticalSpeedFPA`, which read the `A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_*` combine vars), `RequestAutopilotStates`, `SetAltIncrement`. Differences from the A380: **no MTRS/metric toggle** in the Altitude window (real A320 has none); the **Baro** window sets QNH via the proven `A32NX.FCU_EFIS_L/R_BARO_SET` (hPa×16) events (not `CAPT_QNH_SET`/`KOHLSMAN_SET`), **STD/QNH via the `A32NX.FCU_EFIS_L/R_BARO_PULL` (STD) / `_BARO_PUSH` (QNH) knob events — live-verified round-trip 2026-06; the `A32NX_FCU_{LEFT,RIGHT}_EIS_BARO_IS_STD` L:vars are DEAD on the new-FCU A32NX (hold a write but drive nothing, and stay 0 even while actually in STD — the original "STD button doesn't work" bug; dev FBW removed them on the A380 TOO — its STD is now the `A32NX.FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_BARO_{PUSH,PULL}` K-events, read back from `A32NX_FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_DISPLAY_BARO_IS_STD`. **This sentence used to name `H:A380X_EFIS_CP_BARO` + the stock `KOHLSMAN SETTING STD:n` readback; FBW #10855 deleted those H-events, and the A380 now reads the FCU's own per-frame flag instead. The stock mirror is NOT dead — it still tracks both directions — it is simply no longer what MSFSBA reads. See [a380x.md](a380x.md).** CAUTION, the two jets are OPPOSITE: A380 PUSH=STD/PULL=QNH (live-verified 2026-06-11 in the installed fcu.js onPush/onPull), A32NX PULL=STD/PUSH=QNH — never harmonise them). STD state reads `A32NX_FCU_EFIS_L_DISPLAY_BARO_VALUE_MODE == 0`** (mode 0=STD/1=hPa/2=inHg; the mode carries no unit info while in STD, so the window keeps the last known entry unit), unit via `A32NX_FCU_EFIS_{L,R}_BARO_IS_INHG` (dev FBW REMOVED `XMLVAR_Baro_Selector_HPA_*` from the A32NX — exactly inverted vs the A380, where the XMLVAR is live and IS_INHG is stuck). The Ctrl+B window is now Fenix-style (Mode/Unit combos + value box, 2026-06). **Autopilot panel (Ctrl+P)** identical to the A380 (shared `A32NX.FCU_*` events + `A32NX_*` state vars). The A380 FCU windows are Gus's; these are the A32NX mirror.
- **Engine Mode selector display-sync.** The A32NX combo (MainForm special-case) already reads/writes the **stock ignition simvar** `TURB ENG IGNITION SWITCH EX1:1` (via `TURBINE_IGNITION_SWITCH_SET1/2`), so it never had the A380's read-`XMLVAR_ENG_MODE_SEL` staleness bug (fixed in 7b0f661); the A32NX now also nudges `XMLVAR_ENG_MODE_SEL` on set so the cockpit/EWD display matches (the events don't touch it) — the applicable half of that A380 fix.
- **A32NX System Display now has 12 pages (added ENG + F/CTL).** The `A32NX_MSFSBA_SD_PAGE` combo offers E/WD(0), ELEC, HYD, PRESS, APU, COND, WHEEL, BLEED, FUEL, DOOR, **Engine(10)**, **Flight Controls(11)**. Content is decoded SimVars per page (`SdSystemRows`), NOT scraped — the A32NX SD page index is read-only so a page can't be forced (only the E/WD, page 0, is scraped). ENG page reads the stock simvars the FBW SD ENG page uses (`GENERAL ENG OIL TEMPERATURE`/`ENG OIL PRESSURE`/`ENG OIL QUANTITY`/`TURB ENG VIBRATION :n` + `A32NX_FADEC_IGNITER_{A,B}_ACTIVE_ENGn`) — pre-declared as **SimVar** (key underscored, Name spaced, like `ENG_ANTI_ICE:1`) so the SD auto-register loop (now pages 1-11) doesn't mis-register them as L:vars. F/CTL page decodes surface positions from the **FCDC/FAC ARINC429** words (`A32NX_FCDC_1_{ELEVATOR,AILERON}_{LEFT,RIGHT}_POS`, `_ELEVATOR_TRIM_POS`, `A32NX_FAC_1_RUDDER_{TRIM,TRAVEL_LIMIT}*`) + rudder percent + spoiler handle. **STS** (computed inop text — not SimVar-decodable, unscrapable) and **CRUISE** (redundant) are intentionally absent. Source-parity adds to existing pages: ELEC gained DC ESS / AC ESS shed / DC ESS shed buses + APU/emer gen frequency; COND gained pack 1/2 flow valves.
- **A32NX autobrake set uses the calc path.** The Autobrake combo (`AUTOBRAKE_MODE` → `HandleUIVariableSet`) writes `A32NX_AUTOBRAKES_ARMED_MODE_SET` via the MobiFlight **calculator** path (`ExecuteCalculatorCode`), NOT `SetLVar` (the data-def write is unreliable for FBW L:vars). Verified live: `2 (>L:A32NX_AUTOBRAKES_ARMED_MODE_SET)` arms MED, the SET var auto-resets to -1. The FCU value-set events likewise work via the calc-K path (live-verified: HDG/SPD/ALT/VS incl. signed VS round-trip through the `A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_*` readback vars).
- **Phase 4 — the two FBW jets share identical keyboard shortcuts.** Both handle the same `HotkeyAction`s: the A320 gained **ReadFlaps (L)** + **ReadGear (Shift+G)**; the A380 gained **ReadFuelInfo** + a **Ctrl+B Set-Altimeter** dialog (`ShowA380BaroSetDialog`, which uses the stock `KOHLSMAN_SET` = hPa×16, NOT the A320's `A32NX.FCU_EFIS_*_BARO_SET`). NEW on both: **A/THR = Ctrl+J** and **LOC = Ctrl+L** (input mode) → `A32NX.FCU_ATHR_PUSH` / `A32NX.FCU_LOC_PUSH`. **D / Shift+D (distance + time to destination / Top of Descent) now works on BOTH jets** — the A320 reads its FMS `guidanceController` by evaluating `coherent-a32nx-flightinfo.js` on the `A32NX_MCDU` view — once the MCDU window has been opened the MCDU service OWNS that view (`CoherentViewOwnership`, reconnect gaps included) and the script rides its socket (`EvalOnMcduViewAsync`; "Flight management not ready." while it reconnects), and only before that is a one-shot `CoherentEvalClient` eval used (since 2026-09; see Transport below — the two must never both hold the view, and `CoherentEvalClient` refuses a claimed view). ⚠️ The script reads the distance to destination from FBW's per-plan Map (`alongTrackDistancesToDestination`, #9627, 2025-11-25) AND, when that is absent, the older plain `alongTrackDistanceToDestination`: the Headwind A330 0.8.1 (built 2026-01-04) pins FBW at 2025-11-10 and ships only the old field, so with the Map alone plain D said "Destination distance not available" for a whole A330 flight (live 2026-09-26). Check the INSTALLED package's `mcdu.js` before assuming the fork matches its source head — the clone's head pinned FBW 2026-05-10 and would have hidden this. Both share `MainForm.AnnounceFlightInfoJson` for an identical readout. See the "D / Shift+D distance hotkeys" section above.

- **Status-display boxes refresh live — F5 AND auto, without yanking the reader cursor (both jets).** The SD-page status box renders the aircraft def's `_sdPageContent`, an OnRequest **snapshot** that is ONLY rebuilt by `OnDisplayPanelShown → RefreshSdPageDisplayAsync` (which re-reads the underlying SimVars: FOB, engine N1/N2/N3, per-tank fuel, …). **The core bug:** the F5 / Refresh handler re-requested the panel's display vars and re-rendered, but never rebuilt `_sdPageContent` — so it re-printed the SAME stale snapshot and "FOB 13400 KG" never moved, *even on a manual F5*. Fix: the refresh handler now calls `OnDisplayPanelShown(currentPanel)` (fire-and-forget; it pushes its own `UpdateDisplayText` ~0.6 s later when the fresh read completes). Non-SD panels no-op (each def gates on its own panel key: A380 = "ECAM Control Panel", A32NX = "System Display").
  - **The status display is a LISTBOX, not a TextBox (2026-07 rework).** The generic `_DISPLAY_` control is a read-only navigable `ListBox` (one synoptic row per item); every write goes through `MainForm.UpdateDisplayText(ListBox)` → **`Forms.DisplayList.UpdateInPlace`**, which rewrites ONLY the rows whose text changed, grows/shrinks the tail in place (never `Items.Clear()`), and restores the selection by ROW CONTENT — matching the occurrence **nearest the old index** (status lists contain duplicate/blank rows) and **clamping to the last row** when the list shrinks past the cursor (never dropping the selection to -1). A ListBox item-text update never touches a caret, so NVDA's cursor stays on the row being read; a row whose value actually changes re-announces while focused (intended live behaviour). The old TextBox path + its `SetDisplayTextPreserveCaret` wrapper were REMOVED from MainForm. All MCDU/CDU/DCDU forms, the pop-out windows (E/WD, OANS, RMP, HS787 display + EICAS, GSX menu, Weather Radar — via the shared `Forms/DisplayListBox` control), and the ECL now reconcile through `DisplayList.UpdateInPlace`; per-form selection semantics (title/page force-select, CDU positional index restore, ECL FWS cursor-follow) run caller-side after the call. `DisplayText.SetPreserveCaret` survives with a single caller (the OANS Airport tab's one-line box); the GSX status/tooltip boxes keep plain unchanged-guarded `.Text` writes.
  - **Auto-refresh** (`MainForm._sdAutoRefreshTimer`, **1 s**, started/stopped by `StartOrStopSdAutoRefresh()` per panel — only panels with a `_REFRESH_` button): each tick rebuilds any snapshot SD content via `OnDisplayPanelShown` AND force-reads the panel's display vars directly (`RequestVariable(…, forceUpdate: true)` — no more `PerformClick`/2 s-timeout dance), then schedules a repaint. Repaints are **coalesced by `ScheduleDisplayRepaint`**, a one-shot 120 ms timer armed by the FIRST push and NOT restarted by later ones — a bounded leading-edge coalesce. **Do NOT make it a restart-per-push trailing debounce**: hand-fly/takeoff-assist stream `PLANE_PITCH/BANK/HEADING` per SIM_FRAME (~30-60 Hz), those are PFD/ISIS display vars, and a trailing debounce starves — the "live" list froze exactly while hand-flying. **`UpdateDisplayText` always overwrites `displayValues` from `GetCachedVariableValue` first** — displayValues alone goes stale for def-handled vars (`ProcessSimVarUpdate` returns true → the Step-3 write is skipped: A32NX COM freqs, A380 EFIS baro, HS787 flight data); the old 3 s tick masked that by `displayValues.Clear()` via the Refresh button, which the live tick no longer does. The tick still skips while a selector combo is focused; the Refresh handler shows "Loading..." only on the first **empty** populate. Perf invariant: the per-event "is this var in any panel display" gate in `OnSimVarUpdated` uses **`GetDisplayVarNamesCached()`** (a HashSet keyed on the aircraft instance) — never call the defs' `GetPanelDisplayVariables()` per event; it rebuilds its whole dictionary each call (the same lag class `_varCache` fixed for `GetVariables`).
- **Master Warning / Caution acknowledge — clears the aural too (live on the A380, source-correct on the A32NX).** The acknowledge PBs are momentary **buttons** (`Btn`, pulse L:var 1→0) not combos. **A380:** the FBW glareshield.xml HOLD_SIMVAR is misspelled `PUSH_AUTOPILOT_MASTER`**`A`**`WARN_L/R` (extra A) — verified live: pulsing that clears `A32NX_MASTER_WARNING` + cancels the aural, while the no-A name is a no-op; caution `PUSH_AUTOPILOT_MASTERCAUT_L/R` is spelled normally. **A32NX:** `CLEAR_MASTER_WARNING`/`CLEAR_MASTER_CAUTION` already pulse `PUSH_AUTOPILOT_MASTERWARN_L`/`MASTERCAUT_L` (no extra A — the conventional A32NX name; the typo was A380-specific) 1→0 via `HandleUIVariableSet`, rendered as buttons. **DEFERRED (verify when loaded in the A32NX):** confirm the A32NX master-warn/caut pulse actually clears `A32NX_MASTER_WARNING`/`_CAUTION` + the aural live (source XMLs aren't in this fbw-aircraft checkout to cross-check the var name); if the no-A name no-ops like the A380 did, switch to `MASTERAWARN`.

- **A380 button-vs-combo audit (2026-06, 3 parallel source-cross-referenced agents).** Policy: a MOMENTARY cockpit action with no readable resting state → `Btn` (push-button, pulses L:var 1→0, announces "<name> pressed"); a multi-state selector or a LATCHING pushbutton whose pushed-in state matters → COMBO (state stays visible); fire/smoke TESTS stay combos. Changes made:
  - **`Press`→`Btn`** for the momentary push vars whose *latched result* is already a separate readout, so the Released/Pressed combo never settled: `A32NX_OVHD_AUTOBRK_RTO_ARM_IS_PRESSED` (RTO arm; state = `A32NX_AUTOBRAKES_RTO_ARMED` — **live-verified** the 1→0 pulse arms it), `A32NX_OVHD_ELEC_IDG_n_PB_IS_RELEASED` (IDG disconnect; state = `A32NX_OVHD_ELEC_IDG_n_PB_IS_DISC`), `A32NX_OVHD_HYD_RAT_MAN_ON_IS_PRESSED` and `A32NX_OVHD_EMER_ELEC_RAT_AND_EMER_GEN_IS_PRESSED` (RAT manual deploys; momentary `<MOMENTARY/>` in source, Inop in current FBW build but now the correct shape).
  - **`A32NX_TILLER_PEDAL_DISCONNECT` — CORRECTED 2026-06-18 (the `TOGGLE_WATER_RUDDER` mapping was WRONG).** The current FBW A380 systems **read the public L:var directly every frame** (`hydraulic/mod.rs:4664`) and cut pedal-commanded nose-wheel steering while it is 1 (`mod.rs:4567`) — live-verified writing `1 (>L:A32NX_TILLER_PEDAL_DISCONNECT)` latches. The earlier "not consumed → fire `TOGGLE_WATER_RUDDER`" note was stale (the A380 has no water rudder; that event is ignored — the user reported the button did nothing). It is now a **held On/Off toggle** (`OnOff`, NOT a momentary `Btn`): the FBW var is read each frame, so a pulse can't hold the disconnect for the rudder check — On = disconnected, Off = reconnected. `HandleUIVariableSet` writes the L:var (`{value} (>L:…)`). **Do NOT re-add `TOGGLE_WATER_RUDDER`.**
  - **Jet bridge / passenger stairs showed FAKE state.** They were `Retracted/Extended` combos but there is no readable jetway position var and the stock event only TOGGLES — so the combo announced a position it couldn't know, and either option fired the toggle. Relabelled to an honest `Idle/Toggle` action, and the `HandleUIVariableSet` branch now fires `TOGGLE_JETWAY`/`TOGGLE_RAMPTRUCK` only on the active (`>0.5`) value.
  - **Verified correct, left as-is:** master warn/caut acks (`Btn`, incl. the A380 `MASTERAWARN` extra-A spelling), CALLS All/Fwd/Aft/Mech (`Btn`, momentary `FBW_Push_Held`), DCDU ATC ack (`Btn`), ECAM-CP keys (`PressSilent` — all 11 `A32NX_BTN_*` exist; no `STS` key on the A380 ecam-cp), chrono start-stop/reset (buttons firing H-events; fixed a stale "rendered as combos" comment), transponder ident (`Evt`), ground-vehicle requests (`Act` Idle/Request, fire on >0.5). LATCHING state pushbuttons kept as combos: ENG/APU **fire handles** (guarded, pushed-in = armed), APU Start (`_PB_IS_ON` latches), Oxygen Timer Reset (latching toggle), speed-brake/spoiler-arm (multi-state). **FCU not touched** (per user). No stateful toggle is rendered as a momentary `Btn` (the label-staleness trap).
  - **2026-06-18 control fixes (live, in the A380):** (a) **Rudder Trim Reset** is now a **button** (user request — a momentary action) instead of an `Act` combo: a `RenderAsButton` def NOT in `_momentaryButtons`, so the dedicated `HandleUIVariableSet` branch fires `(>K:RUDDER_TRIM_RESET)` on press (the generic `_momentaryButtons` pulse would hit the dead L:var). (b) **Pedal disconnect** corrected to write the L:var (see its bullet above). (c) **RTO Autobrake Arm is working-as-designed, not a bug** — `determine_mode` (autobrakes.rs) only arms RTO when `!should_reject_rto_mode_after_time_in_flight`, i.e. RTO is **rejected for a while after a flight**; on a fresh ground spawn the `Btn` pulse arms it (`A32NX_AUTOBRAKES_RTO_ARMED`→1, auto-announced). The "does nothing" the user saw was arming right after flying. (d) **Clock panel verified** — `A32NX_CHRONO_TOGGLE` H-event live-started the chrono (elapsed 0→9.2 s); start/stop + reset are correct buttons, ET switch is a correct 3-position combo; clock date stays omitted (encoding unclear, cosmetic).

- **A32NX 2026-06-12 live-session adds (all live-verified at a powered gate via the calc path + MCP read-backs):** (1) **Decision Height + Baro Minimum readouts** (`A32NX_FM1_DECISION_HEIGHT` / `_FM1_MINIMUM_DESCENT_ALTITUDE`, ARINC FM words flagged `IsArinc429` — before the flag the announce would speak the raw ~4.29-billion word on change); both are also in the **PFD display set** for on-demand reading (the FM2 MDA entry was a dead registration, removed in the 2026-06-12 bug pass). (2) **Predicted takeoff pitch trim** `A32NX_FM1_TO_PITCH_TRIM` (ARINC degrees, decoded "X.X degrees up/down" / "Not computed" in TryGetDisplayOverride, FCC panel). **⚠️ SIGN IS INVERTED vs the A380:** the A32NX FMS writes `-ths` (`A32NX_FMCMainDisplay.ts:4133 setBnrValue(ths ? -ths : 0)`), so NEGATIVE = nose UP — the first decode copied the A380's `deg > 0 = up` and read UP entries as "down" (caught in the bug pass; never copy a sign convention between the two FMSes without checking the writer). (3) **FUEL MODE SEL** combo (Fuel panel): the cockpit click toggles `A32NX_OVHD_FUEL_MODESEL_MANUAL` AND routes center-tank junctions 4+5. **⚠️ JUNCTION OPTIONS ARE 1-BASED** — the cockpit XML sends `1 l0 +` (= 1+toggled; flight_model.cfg Junction.4/5: Option 1 = auto valve routing, Option 2 = manual direct), so the junction value is **t+1, NOT t** (the first version sent t: "Manual" selected the AUTO routing and "Auto" sent invalid option 0 while the L:var and light claimed otherwise — the earlier "junction 4 follows" live-check only saw THAT a value landed, not WHICH option; full Manual→2/2, Auto→1/1 round-trip live-verified 2026-06-12). (4) **Evacuation horn shut-off** (Evacuation panel): write `1 (>L:PUSH_OVHD_EVAC_HORN)` ONE-WAY — the sound gate plays while the var <= 0 and the EVAC COMMAND re-arm resets it; never pulse it back to 0 (that resumes the horn). (5) **Blue electric pump override** (Hydraulics panel): momentary press-to-TOGGLE — state reads `A32NX_OVHD_HYD_EPUMPY_OVRD_IS_ON` (latches), set pulses `_IS_PRESSED` as TWO SEPARATE calc calls (live-verified: a same-frame `1 (>L:X) 0 (>L:X)` single calc string is NOT seen by the Rust sampler; separated calls toggle reliably — general rule for momentary FBW L:var buttons), and a **delayed (400 ms) forceUpdate read-back** re-syncs the OnRequest latch cache so the desired-vs-current guard can't act on a stale value next time. (6) **SD PRESS manual-mode fallback**: when the active CPC's `CABIN_ALTITUDE` ARINC word goes invalid (MODE SEL → MAN — exactly when the pilot hand-flies cabin V/S), the rows switch to the plain `A32NX_PRESS_MAN_*` L:vars (live-verified plain values, cabin alt −408 ft at the gate). **Colon-indexed L:var injection caveat:** MobiFlight RPN writes AND external Coherent `SetSimVarValue` writes to `L:NAME:1`-style names both no-op (live-tested) — only FBW-internal writers create/update them, so the TCAS VSPEED `:1/:2` band reads can only be verified during a REAL RA; the detail-var (plain names) guidance path was injection-verified end-to-end. **Deferred:** the ACP transmit/volume controls (stock COM events; needs design care).
- **A32NX DCDU (CPDLC) window — Ctrl+Shift+D, input mode (2026-06-12).** `Forms/FlyByWireA320/FlyByWireDcduForm.cs` — live CPDLC uplinks can only be ANSWERED on the DCDU (WILCO/STANDBY/UNABLE/CLOSE/RECALL; the MCDU MSG RECORD only reads history). Transport = **one-shot `CoherentEvalClient` evals** of `Resources/coherent-a32nx-dcdu.js` against the `DCDU` Coherent view (a one-shot is fine here because nothing else holds the `DCDU` view — the old "no persistent A32NX socket" policy is retired, the MCDU now holds `A32NX_MCDU` persistently); refresh on open + 2 s poll + F5 + ~1.5 s after a soft key (the FBW Button component delays its action 1 s for its visual confirm). The scrape collects the SVG `<text>` elements and returns MCDU-style rows: a soft key folds INTO its row (`{t:'keys', l, c, r}`) and the form renders it positionally via the shared `FbwMcduFormat.PositionLine` (24 cols — matched to the MCDU window's default width), so the unit's own star convention marks the adjacent key ("RECALL*" right-aligned = right key; "*STBY" at line start = left key). **The display is a `ListBox` (one accessible row per line), NOT a multiline `TextBox`** (2026-06-16): the TextBox presented the rows so a right-aligned key label (e.g. "RECALL>") read on a SEPARATE braille line from its leading key number; the ListBox keeps each line one discrete row, matching the MCDU window (which uses a ListBox and reads correctly on braille). `SetText` splits on newline and reconciles items in place (BeginUpdate/EndUpdate, preserving `SelectedIndex`, via `DisplayList.UpdateInPlace`) so the 1 s poll never yanks the braille reading position; an unchanged poll is a no-op via the `_lastText` guard. **Multi-line CPDLC message bodies are split into the unit's own display lines** (2026-06-16): the body is ONE `<text class="message-content">` whose word `<tspan>`s WRAP into the DCDU's visual lines, but `getBoundingClientRect` reports the SAME top for every word tspan in the headless Coherent view, so the generic rect-based row clustering collapsed the whole clearance (plus the `OPEN <time> FROM <stn>` header) onto one line. The agent detects the unit's OWN line breaks from the SVG markers — a tspan that resets `x` (has an `x` attr) or steps the baseline (has a `dy` attr) starts a new line (FBW `MessageVisualization` emits a leading x+dy tspan per wrapped line) — and emits each line as its own row with a synthetic increasing `y` so rows keep order between the header above and the soft keys below. Result: one braille line per DCDU display line (e.g. a PDC reads "OPEN 1601Z FROM LPPT" / "CLRD TO EDDB. IXID1N" / "DEPARTURE. MNTN 10000." / … each ≤~23 chars), exactly as a sighted pilot sees it. Do NOT revert the message body to a single rect-clustered line — NO separate key-map listing (the "Left 1 (Ctrl+1): …" lines were rejected in review). **Soft-key SLOT is mapped by POSITION, not Y-order** (`Button.tsx` slot-1 text at y=2240, slot-2 at 2720 of the ~2880 view → normalized 0.86 threshold against the dcdu svg rect): order-mapping is WRONG when only one key renders on a side — the empty-state RECALL is alone on the right but lives on **R2** (`RecallButtons.tsx`), and firing R1 presses nothing (live-caught). Soft keys fire the REAL DCDU H-events via the calc path — `(>H:A32NX_DCDU_BTN_MPL_{L1,L2,R1,R2})` (each Button listens for both units, MPL_ suffices); message nav = `POEPLUS/POEMINUS` (scroll within the displayed message) on **plain PageUp/Down** and `MS0PLUS/MS0MINUS` (older/newer message) on Ctrl+PageUp/Down. **Every DCDU H-event string is SEQUENCE-UNIQUIFIED** (`FireDcduEvent`: `{seq} 0 * (>H:…)`) — MobiFlight client-data coalesces two CONSECUTIVE IDENTICAL command strings, so the WILCO→SEND flow (the SAME R2 slot pressed twice in a row) silently dropped the SEND press (the seat-motor lesson, re-bitten live 2026-06-12; an app restart "fixed" it only because it reset the client-data bytes). **Answering is the real unit's TWO-STEP flow**: first R2 press arms WILCO (keys → L1 CANCEL / R2 SEND), second R2 press transmits, then R2 = CLOSE (source: `WilcoUnableButtons.tsx` showAnswers/showSend states). A "press again to send" auto-announce on the SEND-appears edge was tried and REMOVED at the user's request — the key-row change in the display is enough. Window keys MIRROR THE MCDU LSK SCHEME incl. the shared `MCDUUseAlternateLSKKeys` setting: standard Ctrl+1/2 = left + Alt+1/2 = right; alternate F1/F2 + F7/F8. Display format (final, user-specced): the key NUMBER leads the line with an arrow for the side — `"1 <STBY"` (left key 1) / `"2                RECALL>"` (right key 2, right-aligned within 24 cols); the unit's own `*` armed-marker is stripped. NO explicit "2L"/"2R" labels — position (left-packed vs right-aligned) conveys the side, exactly like the MCDU. Opening releases both hotkey modes (RMP/OANS precedent) so the chords reach the form; disposed on aircraft swap. **Live-verified end-to-end with a real SayIntentions CPDLC session (VCCF):** uplink renders, WILCO arm + SEND transmit work. **ATSU logon gotcha (the user's "can't connect"):** the MCDU NOTIFY key needs ATC FLT NBR + ATC CENTER **+ a FROM/TO destination on INIT** (`fromToAvail` in `A320_Neo_CDU_ATC_ConnectionNotification.ts`) — without a flight plan it shows NOTIFICATION UNAVAILABLE / ENTER MANDATORY FIELDS. **2026-06-12 bug-pass hardening:** (a) **page directions** — DOWN = forward everywhere: PageDown = `POEPLUS` (next page of the displayed message; `POEMINUS` = pageIndex−1 in `MessageVisualization.tsx`), Ctrl+PageDown = `MS0PLUS` (newer message; messages sort oldest-first) — the first version had both inverted, and the within-message direction is LOAD-BEARING: **the answer keys stay INACTIVE until the pilot has paged to the END of a multi-page uplink** (`reachedEndOfMessage` gates `buttonsBlocked`); (b) **per-key ACTIVE flags** — the scrape's stripped `*` is Button.tsx's active marker (an inactive Button ignores its H-event), carried as `act:{L1..R2}`; `FireButton` on an inactive key never falsely confirms, and also guards on `IsMobiFlightConnected` ("Sim connection not ready") — see the stuck-answer-key fix below for what it does now instead; (c) **lifecycle** — `_pollTimer.Start()` after the first await is `IsDisposed`-guarded (restarting a disposed WinForms timer silently re-creates the native timer = zombie 1 Hz eval loop); eval/parse failure on the FIRST render shows "DCDU unavailable. Retrying..." instead of a silent blank window; `ok:false` clears the cached soft keys so chords can't fire a stale layout; a transient scrape-js read failure is no longer cached forever.

- **DCDU stuck answer keys — the lost `reachedEndOfMessage` flag (2026-07-28).** A live CPDLC uplink ("CONTACT ROME MILITARY CENTER ON 123.225", one page) rendered normally but refused WILCO/UNABLE/STBY forever; MSFSBA correctly reported "not available yet. Read to the end of the message first." even though there was nothing left to read. **Root cause is FBW-side, and hits sighted pilots identically** (the DCDU buttons are H-event-only — there is no DOM click path — so a mouse click is refused the same way). Every answer key folds the displayed message's `reachedEndOfMessage` flag into `buttonsBlocked` (`WilcoUnableButtons` / `AffirmNegativeButtons` / `OutputButtons` / `SemanticResponseButtons`), and an inactive `Button` drops its H-event on the floor. That flag is raised in exactly **two** places, both in `MessageVisualization`: the render-time page-count **transition** (`if (messageView.pageCount !== pageCount) reachedEndOfMessage(uid, messageView.pageCount === 1)`) and the `POEMINUS`/`POEPLUS` page-key handlers. `pageCount` is component STATE that survives a message swap, so a new message whose page count MATCHES the one the visualization last rendered never trips the transition — its block keeps the initial `reachedEndOfMessage = false` and every answer key is dead, with nothing on screen to say why. Measured live in the stuck state (React fiber walk over the `DCDU` view): `pageIndex 0, pageCount 1`, block `reachedEndOfMessage: false`, `UNABLE/STBY/WILCO` all `active:false`, and no `*` on any label in the SVG. Firing a single `(>H:A32NX_DCDU_BTN_MPL_POEPLUS)` flipped the flag to `true` and all three keys to `act:true` — confirming both the mechanism and the recovery.
  **Fix** (`FlyByWireDcduForm.ReassertEndOfMessageAndFireAsync` + the scrape's new `page:{idx,cnt}`): an inactive key no longer dead-ends. `POEPLUS` sets the flag from `pageCount <= pageIndex + 2` and does **not** advance the page once the last page is displayed, so at the end of a message it is a pure re-assert that can only unblock — MSFSBA sends it, re-scrapes (`ForceRefreshAsync`, because `RefreshDisplayAsync` no-ops while the 1 s poll is in flight), and presses the key if it came alive **and still carries the same label** (a message arriving in between re-labels the slot; pressing it then would answer something the pilot never chose). The decision needs the unit's own page counter, which `MessageVisualization` renders as two `class="status-atsu"` texts ("PG" + "`<idx> / <cnt>`") and **only when the message spans more than one page** — the scrape now parses it into `page:{idx,cnt}` (0/0 = single page). With pages genuinely unread (`cnt > 1 && idx < cnt`) MSFSBA still refuses, but names the position: *"WILCO not available yet. Page 1 of 2. Press control page down to read on."* — **never** page past unread text on the pilot's behalf. If the key is still refused after the re-assert, the remaining known blocker is a response already transmitting (`ComStatus === Sending`), which no key press can shorten, and the announcement says so. The Headwind A330 (A339X) DCDU is a fork of this code with byte-identical gating, page-key math and `status-atsu` markup, so the same form + scrape fix it there too.

- **DCDU page keys match every other CDU window (2026-07-28).** The DCDU originally put message-stepping on plain PageUp/Down and within-message scrolling behind Ctrl — the opposite of every other CDU form in the app, where **unmodified PageUp/PageDown scrolls the content you are reading**: the A320/A380 MCDUs slew with `UP`/`DOWN` (`FlyByWireMCDUForm` / `FBWA380MCDUForm`), and the PMDG 737/777, HS787 and iFly 737 CDUs all bind plain PageUp/Down (the PMDG/HS787 handlers explicitly require `!Control && !Alt`). It was also backwards on merit: within-message paging is the LOAD-BEARING one here — the answer keys stay inactive until the pilot reaches the end of the message — so it must not sit behind a modifier, while "go read a different message" is the rare action. Now **plain PageUp/Down = `POEMINUS`/`POEPLUS`** (scroll the displayed message) and **Ctrl+PageUp/Down = `MS0MINUS`/`MS0PLUS`** (older/newer message). DOWN = forward is unchanged for both. Do not swap these back to align with the real unit's separate MSG±/PGE± keys — window-level consistency with the other CDUs is what a screen-reader user actually navigates by.
**SimConnect data-definition ceiling** (1000 objects per connection, resets per aircraft switch — the global rule and the fix that hardened it): see [Architecture § SimConnect data-definition ceiling](architecture.md#simconnect-data-definition-ceiling). A32NX-specific note: the strengthening lives in the SHARED `SimConnectManager` — needs a live A32NX connect check (architecturally identical to the A380, just fewer continuous vars, same cache reads).


### FlyByWire A32NX Accessible MCDU

**Feature:** Screen-reader-accessible MCDU for the FlyByWire A32NX, opened with **Shift+M** (input mode) — same shared `HotkeyAction.ShowFenixMCDU` dispatch as the other CDUs, selected by `AircraftCode == "A320"` (Fenix is `FENIX_A320CEO`, so no collision). **Single MCDU (Captain) by design** — see the protocol limitation below.

**CRITICAL — the protocol cannot separate Captain and First Officer MCDUs.** FBW's `A320_Neo_CDU_MainDisplay.sendUpdate()` builds ONE `screenState` from its own display and assigns that same object to BOTH the `left` and `right` keys of every `update` message (only `annunciators`/brightness differ). (Earlier notes described one broadcaster per MCDU writing interleaved; the current FBW build runs a SINGLE MCDU instrument — see below — and the no-separation conclusion is unchanged.) So `content.left == content.right` in every message (verified live: 100% of messages) and a Left/Right selector cannot pick one MCDU — it only drives the two physical MCDUs apart, making the shared display flip last-writer-wins (this was the "adjusting one side changes the other" bug). We therefore mirror FBW's own web remote MCDU exactly: **only ever control the Captain MCDU (`event:left`) and read the single shared screen (`content.left`).** Do NOT reintroduce a side selector or `event:right` — the separation is not achievable over this transport. **The Coherent transport cannot separate them either:** FBW's `panel.cfg` declares ONE `A32NX/MCDU/mcdu.html` gauge on the shared MCDU texture, so a single instrument (a single `A32NX_MCDU` Coherent view) draws both screens — there is no second view to read.

**Transport (2026-09 — Coherent primary, SimBridge fallback):** `Services/FlyByWireMCDUService` is a facade over TWO transports the window never sees, injected through `Services/FbwMcduTransports` (`IFbwMcduCoherentTransport` / `IFbwMcduRelayTransport`) so its routing is tested over fakes (`FlyByWireMCDUServiceTests`). PRIMARY is `SimConnect/CoherentA32nxMcduClient`, a persistent Coherent debugger socket on the MCDU view (`A32NX_MCDU`; the Headwind A330's `A339X_MCDU` — `FlyByWireA320Definition.FlightInfoMcduView`), which installs `Resources/coherent-a32nx-mcdu-agent.js` once and polls its `read()` every 250 ms while the window is visible and every 1 s while it is closed (`SetActive`, wired to `VisibleChanged` in `ShowFlyByWireMCDUDialog`) — a closed window still speaks FMS scratchpad messages and stays current for reopening; showing the window, or a request for a fresh frame, wakes the loop at once (`SimConnect/WakeableDelay`), and when SimBridge carries the screen, showing the window asks it for the current screen too (it pushes only on a change), so a page reached while the window was closed is spoken when it opens. The client CLAIMS its view from Start to Stop (`SimConnect/CoherentViewOwnership`) once its agent has loaded: `CoherentEvalClient` refuses a one-shot eval on a claimed view, and the client does not open its socket while a one-shot started before the claim is still running — it is woken the moment that one-shot ends (`Claim(view, onOneShotDone)`), not a 2 s reconnect pass later. A client that could not load its agent (a damaged install, an antivirus quarantining the file) never connects and claims nothing, and its `EvalForResultAsync` sends the D / Shift+D script as a one-shot instead (`CoherentA32nxMcduClientViewTests`). Its "readable" state — what makes Coherent live and the window say "Connected" — is owned by `SimConnect/CoherentLinkState`: socket open, agent installed and last read ok under ONE lock, every event tagged with its socket's generation (a late answer or close from a replaced socket changes nothing), changes posted in order, every teardown reported to it (the run loop's and `EnsureConnected`'s through `DropSocket`; `Stop` calls `_link.Stop()`; a cancel after connecting and the end of the receive loop report `OnSocketClosed` for their own socket's generation). `read()` rebuilds `A320_Neo_CDU_MainDisplay.sendUpdate()`'s relay payload from the SAME fields on `document.querySelector("a32nx-mcdu").fsInstrument.legacyFms` (`_labels`/`_lines`/`_title`/`_pageCurrent`/`_pageCount`/`_arrows`/`scratchpadDisplay`/`annunciators`, power-gated on `A32NX_ELEC_AC_ESS_SHED_BUS_IS_POWERED` / `AC_2`) and answers not-ready — never a confident blank screen, which would keep Coherent live over a working SimBridge — when `_labels`/`_lines`/`scratchpadDisplay` are missing; so ONE parser, `Services/FbwMcduUpdate`, decodes both transports. `tools/a32nx-mcdu-agent-test` (node, CI) pins the agent against a HAND TRANSCRIPTION of `sendUpdate()` on the fields the decoder reads — it catches the agent drifting from the transcription, not FBW changing the payload, which must be re-transcribed by hand. Keys go through `press(key)`, which dispatches `A320_Neo_CDU_1_BTN_<KEY>` on the instrument's OWN H-event publisher (`fsInstrument.hEventPublisher.dispatchHEvent`), falling back to `bus.pub("hEvent", …, false, false)` (dispatchHEvent's own flags: not synced, not cached) and then `legacyFms.onEvent` — no MobiFlight dependency. The press script (`CoherentA32nxMcduClient.BuildPressExpression`; golden fixture `tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests/Fixtures/a32nx-mcdu-press-DIV.js`, executed against the agent by the node suite) then sets the key's cockpit push-animation variable (`Services/FbwMcduKeyAnimation`: `L:A32NX_MCDU_PUSH_ANIM_1_<model name>`, DIV→SLASH, UP/DOWN/PREVPAGE/NEXTPAGE→UARROW/DARROW/LARROW/RARROW) only after a delivered press, as a TOP-LEVEL statement of the evaluate, because Coherent silently drops a SetSimVarValue made inside a stored agent function (docs/flypad.md). It is the variable FBW's relay handler sets on a press, and FBW's model (`A32NX_Interior_MCDU.xml`) plays the key's push animation from it, whose `mcdubuttons` sound is the key's click — traced in source, not yet heard in the sim. The service routes a key over Coherent whenever that socket holds the view (`HoldsView`, never the arbiter's posted `Live`, which lags), resends a press that provably never reached the instrument (`IsUndeliveredKey`: no socket — including a send that threw — no agent, no instrument, no dispatch path) over the relay when SimBridge is up, never resends an ambiguous one (a timeout, a dispatch that threw: a second press is its own error), logs a key nothing could take, and makes the first Coherent key after a relayed one wait `RelaySettleMs` (300 ms) from the relay send — FBW's keypad applies each key 150-200 ms after it arrives (random) and keeps keys in order only when they ARRIVE ≥ 50 ms apart, so a relayed key could otherwise be overtaken ("250" read as "205"). For the same reason the form's typing loop's 50 ms spacing is load-bearing. `SendButtonPress` returns an `FbwMcduKeyOutcome`. When the page re-evaluates and loses the agent, `read()` answers `no-agent` rather than nothing, so the agent is re-installed on the SAME socket; only evals answered by nothing count toward the dead-socket teardown. FALLBACK is `Services/FlyByWireSimBridgeMcduClient`, the SimBridge relay websocket `ws://localhost:8380/interfaces/v1/mcdu` this window used exclusively before (sim → client `update:{left:{...},right:{...}}`, each side `lines` 12×3 `[left,right,center]` even=label/odd=value, `scratchpad`, `title`, `page`, `arrows` `[up,down,left,right]`, `annunciators`; client → sim `event:left:<KEY>` / `requestUpdate`; the gateway echoes every message to every client). It feeds the window only while the Coherent socket is down, and it is still the ONLY source of MCDU printouts (`print:` exists nowhere but on the relay). `Services/FbwMcduTransportArbiter` (pure, `FbwMcduTransportArbiterTests`) decides which is live: Coherent whenever connected; a frame from the non-live transport is dropped (two sockets narrating one screen a poll apart reads as flicker); on a switch the newcomer is asked for a FRESH frame (`Decision.RequestFreshFrom` — SimBridge sends `requestUpdate`, Coherent clears its change filter and wakes) and NO remembered frame is ever replayed: a hung SimBridge keeps its socket open while its last frame grows hours old, and FBW's MCDU sends SimBridge a blank screen when it detaches, so replaying spoke a stale or empty page even to a closed window. Until the fresh frame arrives the window keeps what it showed. The window's "MCDU connected" is "either transport up", reported on change only; a disposed service passes nothing on (app exit disposes the MCDU window, then the service, as the aircraft switch does). WHY: SimBridge is a separate process the sim never launches, it crashes or hangs on long sessions, and a hung SimBridge still reads as connected to the aircraft (`McduServerClient` reconnects only on socket close), so the MCDU was simply gone until it was restarted. ⚠️ Coherent GT allows ONE inspector socket per view: once the MCDU window has been opened the service OWNS the `A32NX_MCDU` view for the aircraft session, reconnect gaps included, so the D / Shift+D flight-info script always rides `FlyByWireMCDUService.EvalOnMcduViewAsync` (`MainForm.AnnounceA32NXFlightInfo`; "Flight management not ready." while it reconnects) and a one-shot `CoherentEvalClient` eval is used only before the window has ever been opened, or when the Coherent client could not load its agent. The old "no persistent Coherent socket on the A32NX" policy was retired by the maintainers on 2026-09-25.

**Key components:**
- **`Services/FlyByWireMCDUService.cs`** — the facade (see Transport): owns `SimConnect/CoherentA32nxMcduClient` + `Services/FlyByWireSimBridgeMcduClient`, drives `FbwMcduTransportArbiter` on the UI context (both clients post there), forwards `DisplayUpdated`/`ConnectionStatusChanged`/`PrintReceived`, routes `SendButtonPress` by what can deliver the key (Coherent whenever it holds the view, the relay otherwise — see Transport), and exposes `EvalOnMcduViewAsync` for the one-socket-per-view rule (the view itself is owned through `CoherentViewOwnership`). The class remarks document the no-separation limitation for BOTH transports.
- **`Services/FbwMcduFormat.cs`** — decodes curly-brace cell markup (`{green}`/`{small}`/`{sp}`/`{end}`/…) into accessible text and builds the shared `MCDUDisplayData` (extended with `Page`/`Arrows`/`Annunciators`). Mixed-color lines with a green segment mark the active option with `*` (same convention as Fenix) — ONE `*` per green value: FBW sends a value as touching pieces (`10.2`, `/`, `0213`), and a piece that continues a green run gets no star of its own. The star takes NO column of its own where the line has room: `PositionLine` lays the 24 columns out first, then writes each `*` into a spare blank in front of its value, or inserts it and pays the column back from the next gap, so right-hand values stay on column 24 for braille. FBW pads cells with U+00A0 as well as `{sp}`, so `ParseSegments` turns U+00A0 into a plain space as a cell is decoded (and the public `PositionLine` does the same for the DCDU's undecoded text) — nothing downstream sees one, so none can overwrite a neighbouring cell, and titles, scratchpad and cell values carry plain spaces too. FBW draws its entry boxes (`[  ]`, `/[   ]`) from the same character, so the blanks between `[` and `]` are the field's width: `PositionLine` never seats a `*` there or pays one back from them. Write U+00A0 as an escape in these sources, never the literal character (it looks exactly like a space) — `FbwMcduFormatTests.Source_spells_the_no_break_space_as_an_escape` fails on one. **This is a 1:1 mirror of `tools/fbw-mcdu-probe/mcdu-format.js` — keep both in sync.** **CRITICAL — `{`/`}` are overloaded.** They delimit `{tag}` markup AND are the MCDU's literal LSK arrow/bracket glyphs (e.g. a selectable runway renders as `{08L{small}-ILS{end}`). `parseSegments` therefore consumes ONLY *known* tags (colors / `small` / `big` / `left` / `right` / `sp` / `end`); a lone `{` or `}` is the glyph — dropped, with its content kept. Do NOT revert to greedy "`{`…`}` is always a tag" parsing — it ate the runway designators (`08L` etc.) and broke the DEP/ARR pages. **Lines are reconstructed positionally** via `PositionLine` (24 cols: left-aligned left, right-aligned right, centred centre), NOT by dropping blank columns — otherwise a right-only cell collapses onto the left of the line.
- **`Forms/FlyByWireA320/FlyByWireMCDUForm.cs`** — ListBox display + scratchpad TextBox + page buttons (no side selector — single Captain MCDU). LSK keys use the shared `MCDUUseAlternateLSKKeys` setting (Ctrl/Alt+1–6 or F1–F12). Annunciators + page number + ▲▼◄► page-arrow hints render into the display. Only background-state changes are announced per the screen-reader rule, decided by the pure `Forms/FlyByWireA320/FbwMcduReadBack` (`FbwMcduReadBackTests`): a page title once per page and only while the window is OPEN (a page reached while it was closed is spoken when it next shows); the scratchpad through the shared `CduScratchpadAnnouncer` on a 100 ms tick, spoken once it has shown for 400 ms — the tick re-samples the LAST frame, so a count of ticks is a duration, not a count of reads, and 400 ms is longer than one Coherent read with the window open (250 ms plus an eval of up to 150 ms), so there a value seen in a single read (a redraw caught mid-way, or FBW's 150 ms blank before the next queued message) is not spoken — a closed window reads once a second and speaks only FMS messages; each typed key holds the read-back 600 ms, from before it is sent and again once it is delivered, so an entry is read back once, whole; and while the window is CLOSED only an FMS message (a scratchpad that gains text, e.g. DEST EFOB BELOW MIN) — never a page title or "Scratchpad cleared". Connection changes are spoken only while the window is visible.
- **`tools/fbw-mcdu-probe/`** — standalone Node CLI (`watch`/`press`/`type`/`replay`, `--export` JSONL captures) to inspect, drive, and capture the MCDU over the websocket without the C# app. `replay` re-renders an exported capture offline (shareable for diagnosing a page without a live sim). `mcdu-format.js` is the authoritative decode reference; `node --test` covers it.


### Fenix A320 cockpit controls — new "Cockpit" panel section (2026-06)

`FenixA320Definition.GetPanelStructure` has a **"Cockpit"** section with 5 panels exposing 24 previously-uncovered, live-verified-settable L:var combos (all route through `SetLVar` → the MobiFlight calc path):
- **Captain Seat / First Officer Seat** — Seat Height (`S_SEAT_HEIGHT_*`), Seat Distance (`S_SEAT_DISTANCE_*`), Armrest L/R (`S_ARMREST_{LEFT,RIGHT}_*`). Seats are **3-position direction switches** (Height: Down/Stop/Up; Distance: Aft/Stop/Forward) that HOLD the written value — the seat moves while at Down/Up (0/2) and the model **auto-centers the switch to Stop (1) at the travel limit** (no per-frame motor-tick needed, unlike the A380's `SEAT_*_MOVE_*` 0-100 position vars). The Height/Distance combos are `Continuous+IsAnnounced` so they track that spring-to-Stop silently (see the monitor section); armrests are `OnRequest` (2-position, no Stop).
- **Windows and Shades** — sunshades + window blinds (`S_SUNSHADE_*`, `S_WINDOW_BLINDS_*`).
- **Standby Instruments** — `S_STANDBY_COMPASS`, `S_STANDBY_ATTITUDE_CAGE`.
- **Cockpit Other** — jumpseat + headrest, cockpit-door video, oxygen-mask covers, gravity-gear extension + crank, F/O DCDU brightness. (NOTE: the overhead emergency-call guard `S_OH_CALLS_EMER_Cover` is NOT here — it was already defined+paneled in the overhead Calls panel; an early duplicate was removed.)

**DEFERRED Fenix cockpit controls** (need different handling than a plain `SetLVar` combo — implement as `RenderAsButton` pulses / increment events): the **momentary buttons** — cockpit-door unlock/lock, the clock buttons (`S_MIP_CLOCK_CHR/ET/RST/SET/UTC`), the DCDU2 keypad (LSK/MSG/PG/PRINT — control-only since the DCDU2 display isn't readable), `S_MIP_ISFD_BARO_BUTTON`, `S_PED_DFDR_EVENT`, `S_PED_AIDS_PRINT`, `OH_RCRD_GND_CTL`; the **encoders** (`E_STANDBY_ALT_IMPERIAL_BARO`, `E_STANDBY_ALT_METRIC_BARO`, `E_MIP_CLOCK_SET`); and **uncertain-semantics** controls left out on purpose (`S_AUDIO_SWITCHING` accepts 1/2 not 0; `S_CHART_LIGHT_TEMP_CAPT/FO`).


### Fenix monitor manager (Ctrl+M) — now DYNAMIC + clock counters default-off (2026-06)

`FenixMonitorManagerForm` previously listed a **hardcoded 10 keys** (master warnings/cautions + ECAM CLR) — the "weird version". It now enumerates **every `UpdateFrequency.Continuous + IsAnnounced` var** from the aircraft def (mirroring `FBWA380MonitorManagerForm` / `FlyByWireA320MonitorManagerForm`), sorted by display name. Unchecked keys persist to `UserSettings.FenixDisabledMonitorVariables`; `MainForm.OnSimVarUpdated` (~683) already gates on it. Most Fenix cockpit controls (comfort/standby/gravity-gear etc.) are `OnRequest` panel combos — not monitor entries — EXCEPT the 4 seat height/distance switches, which are `Continuous+IsAnnounced` (so the combo can track the spring-to-Stop) but seeded default-silent (see below).

**Default-silenced (monitored but not spoken) vars** — seeded once into `FenixDisabledMonitorVariables` by `SettingsManager.SeedFenixMonitorDefaults` (called from `Load`, guarded by `UserSettings.FenixMonitorDefaultsSeeded`; the user can re-enable any in Ctrl+M, and the flag stops re-seeding after a deliberate re-enable):
- **`N_MIP_CLOCK_CHRONO` / `N_MIP_CLOCK_ELAPSED`** — raw-seconds counters (`IsAnnounced`, no ValueDescriptions) that tick every second → pure announce spam ("CLOCK CHRONO: 3723").
- **The 4 seat height/distance switches** (`S_SEAT_{HEIGHT,DISTANCE}_{CAPT,FO}`) — these were changed from `OnRequest` to **`Continuous + IsAnnounced`** specifically so the panel **combo can track the spring-to-Stop** (the Fenix model auto-centers the 3-position switch to Stop=1 at the travel limit; an `OnRequest` combo kept showing the stale "Up"). They must be `Continuous+IsAnnounced` to be live-monitored (SimConnect only batches `Continuous+IsAnnounced` vars), but the user wanted the value WITHOUT speech — so they're seeded silent. **This works because the combo update (`MainForm.UpdateControlFromSimVar`, ~660) runs BEFORE the disabled-monitor announce gate (~683) in `OnSimVarUpdated`** — the combo's `SelectedIndex` snaps to "Stop" while the announce is skipped. The armrests stay `OnRequest` (2-position, no Stop to spring to). User-set changes don't feed back (`updatingFromSim` guard).


### Fenix momentary buttons are a full PRESS-RELEASE, not press-only (2026-07 — stuck-button fix)

**Every Fenix panel pushbutton routed through `FenixA320Definition.ExecuteButtonTransition` now pulses `0 → gap(200ms) → 1 → hold → 0` — it RELEASES back to 0.** The old code stopped at 1 (`0 → 200ms → 1`), leaving the button **held down for the whole session**. Fenix pushbuttons are momentary (`S_…` catalog value is literally `"0: Off, 1: Press"`): the systems logic latches the effect on the **`0→1` rising edge** and keeps it in a **separate `I_…` indicator**, so releasing to 0 afterwards is the correct real-cockpit behavior and **never loses state** — live-verified that the latched state PERSISTS after release for RMP mode selects (`I_PED_RMP1_VHF2`), EFIS filters (`I_FCU_EFIS1_CSTR`), and ECAM SD page selectors (`I_ECAM_HYD`). For pure momentary actions (ECAM CLR/RCL/EMER CANC, ADIRS keypad, master-warning cancel) the release is a no-op. So the release is **safe + correct for all ~150 buttons** — do NOT revert `ExecuteButtonTransition` to the press-only form.

**Why it mattered — the stuck `S_ECAM_TO` (TO CONFIG test) bug:** that test is **level-triggered** (active only while the button is held at 1). Held-at-1 forever, it stayed inert in flight (FWC inhibits it) but **re-fired against the landing config after touchdown** — once below 80 kt in FWC **phase 9** (on-ground, engines running, no inhibit) → a spurious red `CONFIG` + `SLATS/FLAPS NOT IN T.O. CONFIG` + master-warning aural on rollout. Live-proven: writing `1 (>L:S_ECAM_TO)` fires `I_MIP_MASTER_WARNING_CAPT`; writing `0` clears it. `S_ECAM_STATUS` had the same latent stuck-at-1 (fixed by the same release). `ExecuteButtonTransition` takes an optional `pressHoldMs` (default `ButtonPressHoldMs = 200`) + `onHeld` callback (fires while still held, before release).

**TO CONFIG announces its result** (`AnnounceTakeoffConfigResult`, via the `onHeld` callback + `TakeoffConfigTestHoldMs = 1500`): the button is held 1.5 s so the FWC evaluates the config, then the cached `I_MIP_MASTER_WARNING_CAPT` is read and spoken — "Takeoff config normal." / "Takeoff config: check configuration." — the blind-pilot equivalent of the sighted `TO CONFIG NORMAL`, then it releases. Verification is in-sim (no automated tests); the reproduce/validate recipe is the §5.3 MCP recipe: press `1 (>L:S_ECAM_TO)` → master warning fires → `0` → clears. **First Officer flow has the SAME bug on its own writer** (`FirstOfficer/Generic/LVarActionExecutor.cs` `PulseCoreAsync`, on the `feature/first-officer` branch) — apply the identical release there when that branch is worked.


### Fenix MCDU selected-option marker — colour ALONE is not enough (2026-08)

**Symptom:** the CONFIG > FAILURES page (Failures = LSK 2R) cycles FAILURE TYPE between NONE / MINOR / ALL, but the MCDU window rendered `1: ←NONE/MINOR/ALL  RANDOM*` — **no accessible indication of which option was active**, on any of the three settings. Same for FAILURE RATE (REALISTIC / HIGH).

**How the Fenix encodes a selection.** The `aircraft.mcduN.display` dataref carries inline single-letter codes — colours `a c g m w y`, font sizes `s` (small) / `l` (large), all lowercase and case-sensitive so uppercase display text is never mistaken for a code. A selected option is marked **TWO ways at once: cyan (`c`) AND large font**, with its siblings small + white. Live capture, failure type = ALL, then after ONE `LSK1L` press:

```
before: c£wsNONEl/sMINORl/cALLw  cRANDOM*w    → ALL  is cyan+large
after:  c£wcNONEw/sMINORl/sALLl  cRANDOM*w    → NONE is cyan+large
```

Both markers moved together, which is what establishes the convention (it is also the standard Airbus "selected option is large, the others small" idiom). There is **no failure-mode dataref** — all 481 datarefs were enumerated and only `I_CDU1_FAIL`/`I_CDU2_FAIL` match "fail" — so the display markup is the ONLY source of this state.

**Root cause:** `StripFormatCodes` discarded both signals. Size codes were skipped unconditionally, and the one marker it emitted (a leading `*`) was gated on GREEN: `hasMixedColors = distinctColors.Count > 1 && distinctColors.Contains('g')`. This page's selection is cyan, so the gate was false and nothing was marked. The green-only assumption dates to the original Fenix MCDU commit (`07ba886e`) and had never been revisited.

**Fix:** the decoding moved to `Services/FenixMcduFormat.cs` (pure + unit-tested, mirroring `FbwMcduFormat`), which keeps the per-character large/small flag and adds a **second, additive** rule: within a whitespace-delimited field holding a `/`-separated option group, mark the one option in LARGE font while every sibling is small. The original green rule is preserved byte-for-byte (colour segmentation still splits on every colour code, even a repeated one — verified by differential fuzz: 200 000 random size-code-free inputs decode identically to the pre-fix implementation). Result: `←NONE/MINOR/*ALL` and `←*REALISTIC/HIGH`.

**Rule ordering is an invariant, and the shared marker set is NOT what prevents double-marking.** The colour rule must run FIRST, and the size rule then skips any option token the colour rule already claimed. The `HashSet<int>` only collapses an *identical* index, and the two rules deliberately anchor differently — rule 1 on the green segment's first character, rule 2 on the option's first letter/digit. When a green option starts on a non-alphanumeric (`(`, `[`, `←`, `-`), those anchors differ and the set does nothing: `wsAl/g(B)` decoded to `A/*(B)` before the fix went in and would have decoded to `A/*(*B)` — "star paren star B" on a screen reader — without the per-token overlap check in `MarkFieldIfOptionGroup`. Do not "simplify" that loop away.

**The `currentLarge = true` initial value is load-bearing, not a fallback.** A line starts large and only an explicit `s` makes it small. The NONE-selected capture above carries no size code anywhere before `NONE`, so `NONE` reads as large purely from that initial value — flip it to `false` and that whole capture silently stops marking. The cost is that an unsized-but-meant-small first option would be marked (`ABC/sDEF/sGHI` → `*ABC/DEF/GHI`); the Fenix always emits `s` explicitly to go small, so that shape does not occur in practice. Both facts are pinned by tests.

**The `SpecialChars` glyph table uses `\uXXXX` escapes on purpose.** The keys are Latin-1 supplement characters (`¤ ¥ ¢ £`) matched against live dataref text; as literals in a BOM-less UTF-8 file they would mangle if the file were ever re-saved as CP1252, breaking arrow decoding at RUNTIME with no compile error. Do not "modernise" them to literals.

**Do NOT "simplify" this to a colour test.** Broadening the colour rule to "green or cyan" is the obvious-looking fix and it is wrong: cyan is used throughout the MCDU for entry fields, brackets and the leading `←` cycle arrow, so it would emit an asterisk on nearly every line — including `*←` on this very line. The size rule is deliberately conservative and bails out unless there are ≥2 options, each option's letters/digits are uniformly one size, and EXACTLY one is large; that leaves page counters (`1/1`), labels (`FROM/TO`) and same-size values (`250/.78`) untouched. A token's size is read from its **letters/digits only**, so the always-large `←` prefix can't misreport the first option as selected. The group is bounded by whitespace so the adjacent TRIGGER column (`RANDOM*`) is never pulled in as a fourth option.

`MCDUDisplayData.Lines[]` (the 24-column `SplitLine` pairs) is written but never read — the Fenix form renders `RawLines` — so the marker's column shift has no consumer. If a future feature starts reading `Lines[]`, re-check that truncation.

### The FBW A32NX MCDU does NOT have this bug — checked live, no code change (2026-08)

`FbwMcduFormat` drops `{small}`/`{big}` as "styling only" (`DropTags`, line ~27) — structurally the same assumption that caused the Fenix bug above — so the FBW A32NX was probed live to see whether it loses a selection the same way. **It does not. `FbwMcduFormat` was deliberately left unchanged; do not port the Fenix size rule to it.**

**Method:** ~350 cells across 11 pages read straight off SimBridge (`ws://localhost:8380/interfaces/v1/mcdu`), dumping RAW cell markup so the size tags stay visible: MCDU MENU, INIT A, PERF TAKE OFF RWY, RADIO NAV, INIT FUEL PRED, DATA INDEX, F-PLN, AIDS, ATSU DATALINK, AOC MENU, ATC MENU. (`tools/fbw-mcdu-probe` does the same job but needs Node, which this machine lacks — a throwaway `ClientWebSocket` console app was used instead. Note SimBridge streams updates continuously, so the first frame after a key press is usually STALE: drain to the LAST frame, and never cancel a `ReceiveAsync` to do it — that aborts the socket.)

**Result: zero instances of the Fenix idiom** (a `/`-separated group of ≥2 real options with exactly one large among small siblings). FBW *does* use the size tags meaningfully, but for the other Airbus convention — **large = pilot-entered / entry field, small = FMS-computed, default, or optional**:

```
INIT A          big:"---"   small:"36090"        CRZ FL entry     / TROPO default
PERF TAKE OFF   big:"___"   small:"    F=---"    V-speed entry    / computed F-speed
RADIO NAV       big:"[  ]"  small:"/[    ]"      VOR ident entry  / optional course
```

Those are adjacent FIELDS in one cell, not competing options. Selection/availability on the FBW MCDU is carried by **colour** instead (`{green}<FMGC (REQ)`, `{inop}NAV B/UP>`), which `DecodeCell`'s existing mixed-colour green rule already surfaces.

The RADIO NAV rows are the closest false-positive candidate — they carry both a `/` and mixed sizes — and the Fenix rule would correctly ignore them anyway: `[  ]`/`[    ]` contain no letters or digits, so the `firstAlnum < 0` guard disqualifies the group. The conservatism guards hold against FBW markup too.

**Two things this sweep could NOT reach — re-check them before calling the FBW fully clear:**
- **PERF APPR.** FBW gates PERF page selection on flight phase; on the ground in preflight `NEXTPAGE`/`PREVPAGE` do not move off TAKE OFF. PERF APPR carries `LDG CONF` (CONF 3 vs FULL), the one genuinely mutually-exclusive pair on an A320 MCDU.
- **A populated F-PLN.** No flight plan was loaded, so F-PLN was empty. On a populated F-PLN, FBW renders *entered* speed/altitude constraints large and *predicted* values small — the same number carrying different meaning with no other cue. That would be a real gap of a DIFFERENT kind (not "which option is selected" but "is this value mine or the FMS's"), and it needs a loaded flight plan to observe.

### A32NX dev-feedback sweep (2026-07) — A380-batch bugs mirrored + fixed on the A32NX

The `fix/dev-feedback-batch` A380 fixes were swept against the A32NX with live-sim verification (aircraft at gate, calc-path writes + downstream read-backs). Confirmed + fixed:

- **Approach minimums read the plain-feet L:vars, NOT the FM1 ARINC words.** `A32NX_FM1_MINIMUM_DESCENT_ALTITUDE`/`_DECISION_HEIGHT` are NCD (2^32 → "Not set") until `shouldTransmitMinimums()` passes (phase > cruise, or cruise < 250 NM from destination — `A32NX_FMCMainDisplay.ts`), so a minimum entered at the gate read "Not set". Live-proven: MCDU PERF APPR MDA 220 → `AIRLINER_MINIMUM_DESCENT_ALTITUDE` = 220 instantly at preflight, FM1 word still NCD. Read `AIRLINER_MINIMUM_DESCENT_ALTITUDE` (unset ≤ 0) + `AIRLINER_DECISION_HEIGHT` (unset < 0, FBW writes −1); announce set/change in `ProcessSimVarUpdate`, never on clear. Same fix as the A380.
- **Wing anti-ice writes the real cockpit button var.** `A32NX_PNEU_WING_ANTI_ICE_SYSTEM_SELECTED` is a Rust per-frame OUTPUT (`WingAntiIceComplex::write`) — a write of 1 reverts to 0 in < 2 s at ANY phase (the old def comment's "holds in flight" was a mis-test; the combo actuated nothing). The ONLY input the pneumatic system reads is `A32NX_BUTTON_OVHD_ANTI_ICE_WING_POSITION` (`WingAntiIcePushButton::read`) — live-verified: the button write holds AND `_SYSTEM_SELECTED` follows. Never switch the combo back.
- **Nose + landing lights are driven by the indexed stock events, not the `LIGHTING_LANDING_x` L:vars.** Writing `LIGHTING_LANDING_1` holds but drives NOTHING (nose taxi lamp stayed on for 6 s+ with the L:var at Off); `LIGHTING_LANDING_2/3` writes REVERT — the retractable-switch template re-derives them per frame from lamp + retract state. The working actuator (live-verified on/off, correct index selectivity) is the FBW template's own RPN form, used **verbatim**: `<value> <index> r (>K:2:LANDING_LIGHTS_SET)` / `(>K:2:TAXI_LIGHTS_SET)`. NOTE (2026-07 correction to this note itself): RPN `r` **swaps the top two stack entries** (SDK-documented), so `<value> <index> r` is stack-EQUIVALENT to `<index> <value>` — FBW's own `FBW_Switch_LeftClick_MouseWheel` template (Airbus.xml) uses the index-first no-`r` shape for the same events. An earlier live test read the index-first form as a no-op; the two forms cannot differ, so that failure had another cause (most plausibly MobiFlight's coalescing of consecutive identical calc strings, or pre-existing lamp state). Keep the template-verbatim `r` form — it is the live-verified one — but do not "fix" index-first occurrences elsewhere on the strength of the old no-op claim alone; re-verify live first. Nose positions: T.O. → `LANDING:1`=1 + `TAXI:1`=1 ("allow TAXI LT with TO LT"); Taxi → `LANDING:1`=0 + `TAXI:1`=1; Off → both 0. Wing landing lights: fire the event + write `LANDING_{2,3}_RETRACTED`; the template then converges `LIGHTING_LANDING_2/3` by itself (live-verified), so the combo state stays backed on the L:var.
- **Wipers are OFF/SLOW/FAST synthetic combos with two-var live readback** (port of the A380 fix; circuits **77 Capt / 80 F/O** — not 141/143). The circuit-switch bool alone can't read back FAST, and `CIRCUIT POWER SETTING` rests at 100 % while the switch is off (a cold-start switch-off + power-100 must read OFF, not FAST). Combos `WIPER_LEFT/RIGHT` (synthetic, hold last set); true position decoded from hidden `WIPER_{L,R}_SW`/`_PWR` backers via `WiperState` into the Wipers display box. The old combos were keyed on `XMLVAR_A320_WiperSwitch_*` — a var that does not exist in FBW.
- **VOR/ADF frequency readouts get unit labels** (`ND_VOR*_FREQ` "108.90 MHz", `ND_ADF*_FREQ` "890.0 kHz", out-of-band → "not tuned") — an unlabeled "890" was ambiguous; COM already formats via its own /1000 F3 override.
- **"Passengers on Board" (new Status panel, Instrument section) sums the `A32NX_PAX_{A..D}_DESIRED` bitmasks** — the PLANNED load (flyPad/GSX/loadsheet number), not the lagging boarded set (`A32NX_PAX_{st}`) — the A380 pax lesson applied at feature-add time. Station bitmasks ≤ 53 bits → exact as double; popcount per station in `ProcessSimVarUpdate`.
- **Completeness switches added** (all live-verified settable + held via the calc catch-all): fire-handle guards `A32NX_FIRE_GUARD_{ENG1,ENG2,APU}`, cargo-smoke discharge guards `A32NX_CARGOSMOKE_DISCH{1,2}LOCK_TOGGLE`, ELT ON + ELT TEST/RESET, Data Loading Selector, rain repellent L/R (momentary holds; the cockpit MODEL has the two node→var assignments crossed — expose by VAR name).

Verified NOT bugs on the A32NX (do not "fix"): **seat belts is genuinely 2-position** in the FBW A32NX model (no AUTO — unlike the A380; the SEATBELT_AUTO panel light is a FIXME stub); **takeoff trim** correctly reads `A32NX_FM1_TO_PITCH_TRIM` as DEGREES with the `-ths` sign inversion (entry-time write, not distance-gated); **SD colon-indexed L:vars** were already classified by SPACE-only; **runway-turnoff wiring** via `LIGHT TAXI:2/3` was already right (only its RPN form needed the `r` fix); shared weather/altitude-callout fixes are aircraft-independent.

### Circuit breakers + the 2026-08 ECAM message sync (FBW #10878 / #10717)

**Only ONE circuit breaker is actually modelled — do NOT build a CB panel.** FBW #10878 added an A32NX circuit-breaker system, and it is tempting to read the 27 `A32NX_CB_*_TRIPPED_*` L:vars as "lots of new controls". They are not. Those vars are the **SDAC's monitoring table**: each is a 32-bit mask, and `CircuitBreakerMonitors.ts` declares which bits the FWC watches — **196 monitored CB positions across 7 ECAM groups** (rear panels J-M / N-R / S-V / W-Z, overhead, L and R elec bay). But the cockpit model instantiates exactly one clickable breaker: `CircuitBreaker.xml` defines `FBW_A32NX_CB_49VU` with a single `<CB_1>E12</CB_1>`, and `A320_NEO_INTERIOR.xml` uses that one template. **49VU E12 is the ECAM Control Panel's own power supply** (`Ecp.ts`: `new CircuitMonitor(this.bus, UpstreamBus.DcEss, '49VU', 'E', 12)`) — which is the whole point of the PR. The other 195 positions have no 3-D breaker, no tooltip and no name, so exposing them would mean inventing ~195 nameless controls for objects that do not exist in the aircraft. Encoding, if a real one is ever added: var `L:1:A32NX_CB_{PANEL}_{ROW}_TRIPPED_{floor((col-1)/32)}`, bit `(col-1) % 32`, pull = `OR` the bit, reset = `AND NOT` it.

**⚠️ The CB vars are only reachable through the `L:1:` form.** The systems read `RegisteredSimVar.create('L:1:A32NX_CB_…', Enum)`. Writing the unprefixed `(>L:A32NX_CB_…)` updates a DIFFERENT variable — it sticks on read-back but the FWC never sees it (live-burned 2026-08-16: `L:…` = 2048 while `L:1:…` = 0). Since `SimConnectManager.SetLVar` always emits the unprefixed form, **MSFSBA cannot currently pull a breaker**; a control would have to write `<mask> (>L:1:VAR, enum)` explicitly through the calc path in the def, and read it back by registering the var name as `1:NAME`. See the golden rules in [troubleshooting-playbook.md](troubleshooting-playbook.md).

**The C/B TRIPPED ECAM messages ARE wired and DO get spoken — verified end to end (2026-08-16).** Gating found in `CircuitBreakerLogic.ts`: a monitored bit set **AND** FWC flight phase 1, 2 or 6 **AND** held for a **60-second** confirm node (`NXLogicConfirmNode(60, true)`) — so a trip is silent for a full minute before the caution appears; do not conclude "it doesn't work" after 15 s. Live test on the running build (`a32nx-v2024.2.0-dev.7dbada1`): setting `L:1:A32NX_CB_49VU_A_TRIPPED_0` bit 0, phase 1, produced the announcement in MSFSBA's own log — `New ECAM message detected for announcement: 'C/B TRIPPED ON OVHD PNL, Amber'`. Note the ECP breaker (49VU E12) is a poor test subject: pulling it unpowers the ECAM Control Panel itself, so pick another monitored bit in the same group.

**Stray "m" in every grouped ECAM announcement — FIXED.** The live test above first came out as *"C/B **m** TRIPPED ON OVHD PNL"*. Cause: each grouped title is stored `"\x1b<4m\x1b4mC/B\x1bm TRIPPED…"`, and the closing `\x1bm` is ESC + a literal `'m'`; `CleanANSICodes`' control-character pass turned the ESC into a space and left the letter stranded as its own word, which the screen reader spoke. This affected **every** grouped message on the A320 table (`BRAKES m HOT`, `T.O m AUTO BRK`), not just the new ones. `CleanANSICodes` is now the same ESC-anchored single regex the A380 lookup has always used (`\x1b[<)\d]*m`, which covers the bare ESC+`m` reset) plus a `ƴm` alternate for this table's compile-time mojibake — C#'s greedy `\x` escape makes `"\x1b4m"` compile to `U+01B4 'ƴ' + 'm'`, which is also why four action lines briefly stored as `"\x1b5m"` (`308118602/3`, `308128002/3`) announced a stray `Ƶm` with no colour word until they were corrected to `"\x1b<5m"`. The old non-anchored digit pass that could eat real text like "75m" is gone with the consolidation. The characterization tests that pinned the old residue were updated deliberately — if one ever fails claiming a missing `m`, the fix has been reverted, not broken.

### The armed ALT call-out names an FMS altitude constraint (2026-08-23)

Ported from the A380 fix (see [a380x.md](a380x.md) for the full derivation). The two airframes
agree on the SEMANTIC and differ only in how the aircraft carries the qualifier, so
`ArmedAltitudeMode` is shared and each def supplies its own source.

**⚠️ The A32NX is NOT a verbatim copy of the A380 here — do not port by assumption.** Three
things differ, and each was checked against the source:

| | A380 | A32NX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| armed bits come from | PRIM FG discrete word 2, bits 11/13/14/15/16/18 | FMGC A-bus discrete word 3, bits **12/22/23/24/25** |
| constraint qualifier | FG word 3 **bit 28** (`alt_cstr_applicable`) | **the SSM** of `A32NX_FMGC_{1,2}_FM_ALTITUDE_CONSTRAINT` |
| cruise-altitude flavour | FG word 3 bit 29 (`altIsCrzAlt`) | **none** — the A32NX FMA has no ALT CRZ branch |

Only the final `verticalArmed = altArmed | (clbArmed << 2) | …` expression is byte-identical
between the two WASM shims, which is exactly what makes "it's shared" a tempting and wrong
conclusion.

**The SSM *is* the flag, not a proxy for it.** `FmgcComputer.cpp:4898`:

```cpp
if (alt_cstr_applicable) fmgc_a_bus.fm_alt_constraint_ft.SSM = NormalOperation;
else                     fmgc_a_bus.fm_alt_constraint_ft.SSM = NoComputedData;
```

so the word is read for its VALIDITY and its number is never used — which is also precisely what
the A32NX PFD reads (`FMA.tsx`: `altAcqArmed && !clbArmed && altConstraint.isNormalOperation()`).
`ConstraintApplicableFromConstraintWord` gates on Normal Operation **only** — the accessor its own
PFD uses for a value word's validity, where the A380 reads a discrete bit and uses `bitValueOr`.
Each mirrors its own aircraft; neither is stricter than the other, so do not "harmonize" them.

**Both FMGCs are read, and the qualifier applies if either says so.** The armed bitmask MSFSBA
receives follows `fmgcPriorityIndex`, so an FMGC-1-only read would go quiet whenever FMGC 2 held
priority. In normal dual operation both compute the same constraint, so the OR changes nothing;
under a single failure it keeps the call-out alive instead of silently degrading.

**The PFD's extra `!clbArmed` term is deliberately NOT reproduced**, on either airframe. That
term decides which single label to draw in one text slot, not whether the armed altitude is a
constraint — the A380's own colour rule has no such term, and MSFSBA announces each newly-armed
mode separately rather than only the top-priority one.

**Bit 2 removed, bit 64 kept — and the difference is the point.** The old
`(2, "Altitude constraint")` row could never fire: the shim skips bit 1 because
`base_fmgc_armed_modes` has no constraint member at all (it carries `alt_acq_armed` /
`alt_acq_arm_possible`, same as the A380's bus). That is structural, so the row is gone. Bit 64
(TCAS) also cannot fire today — the A32NX shim hardcodes `bool tcasArmed = false;` where its
siblings read a bit — but that reads as *not yet wired* rather than *not modelled*, so the entry
stays and starts working the day FBW wires it.

**⚠️ Source-verified, not sim-verified.** There was no A320 loaded when this was written. Every
claim above is traced to the FBW tree; the live measurement behind the A380 half has no A32NX
counterpart yet. (That A380 measurement was recorded as "bit 28 TRUE at FL360 with nothing armed";
decoded as FBW decodes a discrete word it was bits 29 and 20 — the CRUISE qualifier and ALT hold —
see a380x.md, "Discrete ARINC words were read from the wrong bits". The A32NX FMGC discrete words
this file reads — the LAND 2/3 capability bits among them — were misread by the same bug until
2026-09-25.) (The dispatch-ordering measurement below
is a separate matter — it is measured against MSFSBA's own registration, not the FBW source.)

**The armed-ALT call-out is HELD until the qualifier settles, and the flush re-checks the Ctrl+M
mute ITSELF.** `A32NX_FMA_VERTICAL_ARMED` sits at continuous-batch 1 index 169 while the two FMGC
constraint words sit at 172/173 — three slots later in the SAME batch (164/167/168 before PR
#140's FCU sources sorted in ahead of them) — so naming the ALT bit
inline read the PREVIOUS sample's constraint. Only the ALT entry is held, and it is released by
the DELIVERY of the batch carrying the constraint words, not by a timer and not by those words'
own `ProcessSimVarUpdate` branches (which run only when a value CHANGED, and so cannot report an
unchanged-but-now-current qualifier). Because that batch is the same one the arming bitmask rides,
the flush lands at the tail of the same message — no delay at all on this airframe. The def names
the word to wait on through `DeferredFlushWatchVariable`, and returns **FMGC_2**, not FMGC_1: the
two are OR'd so both must be current, and `A32NX_FMGC_2_...` sorts after `A32NX_FMGC_1_...`, so
waiting on the later of the two is correct whether they share a batch (they do today) or ever
straddle the 300-var boundary. See [a380x.md](a380x.md) for the full derivation, the measured
ordering on both airframes, why a wall-clock backstop was rejected, and the disproven
`GetCachedVariableValue` approach that must not be re-attempted.

The mute re-check is the one piece that is **A32NX-specific, and it is a trap for the next
deferred announcement added to this def.** This aircraft is muted CENTRALLY: MainForm wraps
`announcer.Suppressed` around the whole `ProcessSimVarUpdate` call, because vars like the A320's
EFIS baro readouts (and the Headwind A330's stock-Kohlsman altimeter, which shares the wrap)
announce from INSIDE it and return true — exiting before the generic
`A32NXDisabledMonitorVariables` gate below, so a Ctrl+M un-tick never muted them. The
`a32nxMuted` comment in `MainForm.Announcers.cs` is the authority.
Anything delivered through a callback rather than through `ProcessSimVarUpdate` — a timer tick, or
the `OnDeferredFlushBatchDelivered` batch hook — runs OUTSIDE that wrap and must consult
`A32NXDisabledMonitorVariablesSet` for itself; this def's `OnDeferredFlushBatchDelivered` does,
via the shared `ArmedAltitudeMode.ShouldSpeakHeldAlt`. The A380 has no such trap: its armed branch
checks `A380DisabledMonitorVariablesSet` locally, so its flush inherits the same check by writing
it the same way.

### VFE and VS now read the FAC bus — FBW #10890 deleted the plain L-vars (2026-09-22)

**FBW #10890 (`c0421a9`, 11 Sep 2026, "various AFS fixes") stopped the A32NX publishing
`A32NX_SPEEDS_VFEN` and `A32NX_SPEEDS_VS` at all.** The writes were deleted from
`A32NX_Speeds.ts`; the values still exist inside `NXSpeeds` but nothing puts them on an
L-var any more. Nothing was renamed, so a name-diff sweep finds nothing — the vars simply
stop being written and read a stale `0` forever. That is the failure mode to fear: the VFE
and VS readouts did not go silent, they confidently said a wrong number.

The readouts now take the FAC's own characteristic speeds, which is what the PFD tape uses:

| Readout | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VFE | `A32NX_SPEEDS_VFEN` | `A32NX_FAC_1_V_FE_NEXT`, else `A32NX_FAC_2_V_FE_NEXT` |
| VS | `A32NX_SPEEDS_VS` | `A32NX_FAC_1_V_STALL_1G`, else `A32NX_FAC_2_V_STALL_1G` |

VS keeps its meaning: `V_STALL_1G` is the 1g stall speed, the same quantity the deleted
`A32NX_SPEEDS_VS` carried, and the call-out still says "Stall Speed". Like the PFD, FAC 1 is
read first and FAC 2 is the fallback when FAC 1 has nothing to say (failed, or switched off).

Both are **ARINC429 words**. They are NOT read through the hardcoded temp-def/dispatch path
(ids 330-337, which hands the value on as a plain number): each `SpeedRequestTable` entry
carries its encoding — `PlainSpeed` for that path, `FacSpeed` for a FAC word — and a
`FacSpeed` is read through its registered `IsArinc429` definition (`FAC_n_V_FE_NEXT`,
`FAC_n_V_STALL_1G`) with `ReadFreshAsync` and decoded by `TryDecodeArinc429`, the same decode
the panel rows use. A bad SSM is spoken as "not available" rather than as a number. Never add
ARINC decoding to dispatch cases 335/337: they still carry a plain number for the Headwind
A330 (below).

⚠️ **VFE and VS are now IN-FLIGHT ONLY.** The deleted plain L-vars were valid on the ground;
a FAC word carries a no-computed-data SSM until the FACs have air data, so both say "not
available" on stand. That is a real behaviour change — and not one worth avoiding, because the
variable it replaces reads a stale 0 on the ground too, it just says it with a number.

⚠️ **The A380 is NOT affected and must not be "fixed" to match.** The A380X still writes
both plain L-vars (`FmcAircraftInterface.ts`), and `FlyByWireA380Definition` derives from
`BaseAircraftDefinition` — not from `FlyByWireA320Definition` — so it reads them through its
own `RequestReadout` path and shares none of this.

⚠️ **The Headwind A330 inherits this table and must KEEP the plain L-vars.** Checked against
`headwindsim/aircraft` @ `41eace7` (14 Aug 2026), not assumed: it still writes both from the
pre-#10890 `A32NX_Speeds.ts` it forked (lines 22/29/69/75), and its FACs publish **six**
variables in total — `DISCRETE_WORD_2`, `HEALTHY`, `RUDDER_TRIM_POS` per side — **not one of
them a characteristic speed**. None of the FAC speed words exist on that airframe, so
`HeadwindA330Definition` overrides `SpeedRequestTable` with all-`PlainSpeed` sources, and drops
the base PFD panel's FAC rows (`PFD_VSW`, `PFD_VALPHAPROT`, `PFD_VALPHAMAX`), which would read
"not available" all flight. Revisit only if Headwind syncs #10890.

**Requires a FlyByWire A32NX Development build from 11 Sep 2026 or later** for the plain
L-vars to be gone; the FAC words predate #10890, so this migration also works on an older
build.

⚠️ **Known residual from #10890, NOT fixed (found 2026-09-25): the PFD status box's "Managed
speed" row (`A32NX_SPEEDS_MANAGED_PFD`) no longer matches the PFD in two phases.** #10890 moved
ground-speed mini and the SRS go-around target out of the FMS and into the FMGC, so in approach the
L-var holds plain VAPP while the PFD's target is VAPP plus ground-speed mini (whenever a wind is
entered on PERF APPR), and in an SRS go-around it holds green dot or the speed constraint. The PFD
now draws `A32NX_FMGC_{1,2}_PFD_SELECTED_SPEED` (FMGC 2 when FMGC 1's word is invalid; FCU selected
speed when neither is) and calls it managed when `A32NX_FMGC_x_DISCRETE_WORD_5` bit 19 is set and
bit 20 clear (`SpeedIndicator.tsx`). The fix is to read that word the same way — keeping the old
L-var for the Headwind A330, whose pre-#10890 FMS still writes the ground-speed-mini target. Display
only: nothing announces this row.

### Cleared V-speeds are spoken "not set" (2026-09-25)

FBW #10855 (`1bbd304`, 18 Aug 2026 — the A32NX half of an A380 commit, in `A32NX_FMCMainDisplay.ts`)
changed the FMS's cleared V1 and VR from 0 to -1 (V2 stays 0). The FMS clears all three itself as
the flight phase passes TAKEOFF, and on a takeoff-runway change, so every climb-out was announced as
"V1: -1 knots, VR: -1 knots, V2: 0 knots" (it was "0 knots" before, no better). `PFD_V1`/`PFD_VR`/
`PFD_V2` now carry `SimVarDefinition.NotSetBelow = 1`, so `FormatVariableValue` says "V1: not set";
a threshold rather than a `ValueDescriptions` key, because a sentinel written in knots and read back
through the sim's base unit need not come back bit-exact. The A380 and the Headwind A330 (which
inherits these definitions and still clears to 0) get the same wording. Pinned by
`FbwVSpeedNotSetTests`.

The status-box panels read "not set" too: MainForm's panel formatter and `FormatVariableValue` both
ask `SimVarDefinition.IsNotSet`, the one test (the panel showed "V1: -1" while the readout already
said "not set"). And the FMS's own post-takeoff clear is no longer SPOKEN on the A32NX (and the
Headwind A330, which inherits it): `A32NX_FMCMainDisplay.ts` clears all three once the phase is past
TAKEOFF, which made three "not set" lines on every climb-out. The definition consumes a cleared
V-speed silently once `A32NX_FMGC_FLIGHT_PHASE` is TAKEOFF or later, and still leaves to the monitor
a clear made before takeoff thrust (a runway change — the FMS's only other clear — when the pilot
must re-enter them) or with the phase unknown. ⚠️ The gate is phase ≥ TAKEOFF, NOT past it: the
phase rides continuous batch 1 and the V-speeds batch 2 (separate once-a-second requests, measured
about 405 ms apart), and the FMS clears on its own 1-second throttle, so the clear can reach MSFSBA
before the CLIMB phase does. It can never arrive with anything below TAKEOFF, which is set when
takeoff thrust is. (A first version gated on "past TAKEOFF", reasoning from the name sort within one
batch; a second review found the two ride different batches.)

### Discrete-word readouts were decoded from the wrong bits (fixed 2026-09-25)

The A32NX shares `Arinc429Word` with the A380, and until 2026-09-25 its `BitValueOr` tested a
discrete word's RAW float bits instead of the bitfield the float's value carries (docs/a380x.md,
"Discrete ARINC words were read from the wrong bits"). Every A32NX discrete readout read noise: the
LAND 2 / LAND 3 capability (FMGC discrete word 4, bits 23/24/25), the active-CPC choice on the PRESS
and CRUISE pages (CPC word bit 11) and the COND page's hot air valve / pushbutton and cabin fans (ACSC
word 1, bits 20/23/25/26). The bit numbers themselves were checked against the FBW writers and SD
pages and are right.

**FWC word 124 was also mislabelled.** Bits 24 and 25 are an ALTITUDE discrepancy between the sides
— one side's altitude off the other's by 250 ft for 5 s, with both sides in STD (24) or both in
QNH/QFE (25) — which drives the PFD's CHECK ALT flag and ECAM "NAV ALT DISCREPANCY"
(`PseudoFWC.ts`). MSFSBA spoke them as "Baro standard mode / reference discrepancy", a baro-setting
mismatch neither bit can signal (FBW's real BARO REF DISCREPANCY drives an ECAM alert only and is in
no word). It is now one call-out, "Altitude discrepancy between sides", on the rising edge of either
bit, and the Ctrl+M row is "Altitude Discrepancy". Pinned by `A32nxAltitudeDiscrepancyTests`.

**…and it had never fired at all.** PseudoFWC builds word 124 with
`Arinc429RegisterSubject.createEmpty()` and never sets its SSM (word 126 beside it gets
`setSsm(NormalOperation)`; 124 does not), so the L:var always carries Failure Warning and every
SSM-gated read (`BitValueOr`) returns its fallback — silent before the decoder fix and after it. The
PFD reads CHECK ALT from it with `bitValue`, which ignores the SSM, and so does MSFSBA now
(`Arinc429Word.BitValue`, which is for exactly this kind of word and no other: everywhere else a
failed word must say nothing). The call-out has therefore never been heard in the sim — it wants a
live check, for example with the two sides' QNH set 10 hPa apart (about 280 ft; `PseudoFWC` compares
each ADR's baro-corrected altitude with the other side's displayed one) for more than 5 s in flight.

### FCU hardware-dial callouts — speak only what the window SHOWS (PR #140, 2026-09)

Turning an FCU knob on hardware (MobiFlight, FSUIPC, the 3-D cockpit) speaks the new value on the
A32NX, the Headwind A330 and the A380X — the PMDG 777's MCP callouts. The definition composes a
phrase per delivery (`TryComposeFcuValuePhrase` → `FcuValuePhrases`) and `FcuValueAnnouncer`
decides whether it is spoken. Pinned by `FbwFcuDialAnnounceTests`, `FcuValuePhrasesTests` and
`FcuValueAnnouncerTests`. The A330 inherits the A32NX path unchanged and its fbw.wasm carries every
source name below, but on this alpha airframe "present in the wasm" has not always meant
"delivered" (see the baro note in `HeadwindA330Definition`) — unverified in the sim; the failure mode
is silence.

**⚠️ The sources are the whole feature.** While a window shows dashes, the A32NX FCU keeps copying
the aircraft's LIVE data into its plain display values (`FcuComputer.cpp`: the dashes branches set
the heading value from the ADIRS heading or track, the speed from CAS or Mach clamped 100-399, and
the V/S from the current vertical speed rounded to 100 fpm). The first version announced
`A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_{HDG_TRK,SPD_MACH,VS_FPA}_VALUE`, so the heading was read out as the
aircraft turned on the ground (the report that found it), and the airspeed and vertical speed
would have been narrated through every take-off roll and managed climb. Pairing those values with
the separate `…_DASHES` flags does not fix it either: the flag and the value arrive on different
SimConnect deliveries, so the order races. Every source must say ON ITS OWN whether its window
shows a selection:

| | A32NX / A330 | A380X |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heading | `A32NX_AUTOPILOT_HEADING_SELECTED` (shim, -1 while dashed or the FCU failed) | the same name (-1 while dashed; the A380 writer has no FCU-failed term) |
| Speed | `A32NX_AUTOPILOT_SPEED_SELECTED` (shim, -1 while dashed; Mach below 10, knots above) | the same name |
| Altitude | `A32NX_FCU_SELECTED_ALTITUDE` (FCU bus ARINC429 word; Failure Warning when the FCU has failed) | stock `AUTOPILOT ALTITUDE LOCK VAR:3` (`FCU_ALT_VALUE`), metric under MTRS |
| V/S | `A32NX_FCU_SELECTED_VERTICAL_SPEED` (FCU bus word) | `A32NX_PRIM_1_SELECTED_VERTICAL_SPEED` (PRIM FG word) |
| FPA | `A32NX_FCU_SELECTED_FPA` | `A32NX_PRIM_1_SELECTED_FPA` |

The V/S word is Normal Operation only while the V/S window shows a V/S selection — No Computed
Data while dashed or in TRK/FPA — and the FPA word the reverse (`FcuComputer.cpp` bus-output SSMs;
the A380 PRIM's `A380PrimComputerFctl.cpp` mirrors them, and its FCU shows dashes exactly when the
master PRIM's word for the active mode is not Normal Operation). So neither needs the TRK/FPA mode,
and a selected V/S of 0 (a push-to-level-off) is spoken while dashes are not. The
`A32NX_AUTOPILOT_{VS,FPA}_SELECTED` shims are NOT sources on either airframe: on the A380 they read
0 while dashed, on the A32NX they carry the LIVE vertical speed or FPA while dashed, and both read 0
in the other mode. The A32NX altitude comes from its word rather than
`A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_ALT_VALUE` because a failed FCU zeroes the display value, which spoke
"Altitude 0 feet". The A380's PRIM 1 words carry the same single-source limitation as its PRIM 1
envelope speeds: with PRIM 1 not the master they go silent rather than follow PRIM 2/3. Batched
sources are registered with Units `"number"` — a batched L:var is read in its registered unit, and a
unit conversion would destroy a packed word (individual defs always read an L:var as `"number"`,
whatever Units says).

**FCU availability.** A callout is only released while the FCU itself is producing values —
`A32NX_FCU_HEALTHY` (A32NX/A330) or `A32NX_FCU_AFS_CP_ACTIVE` (A380, `fcu1||fcu2 afs_cp_active`).
It rides the SAME continuous batch as the heading/speed shims and (A380) `FCU_ALT_VALUE`, pinned by
`FcuHealthBatchMembershipTests` against the production layout (`ContinuousBatchLayout`). Within the
batch it sorts AFTER the shims but BEFORE the A32NX `A32NX_FCU_SELECTED_*` words, and the A380's
stock altitude sorts first of all; the A380's PRIM 1 V/S and FPA words sort so late they currently
ride the NEXT batch and are judged against the health delivered one batch earlier. Either order is
safe because nothing is spoken until the batch ends: a health drop clears whatever was staged
before it and blocks anything staged after it, and a return starts a settle. Every source
above also composes `FcuValuePhrases.Unavailable` on its own when its word reads Failure
Warning/Functional Test (self-test); on the A380 only, so do the speed shim's and `FCU_ALT_VALUE`'s
own impossible zeros (the FCU never selects 0 kt/Mach, and its selected altitude is never below
100 ft, so 0 can only mean "off"). The HEADING shim's zero is NOT one of these:
`FcuValuePhrases.Heading`/`HeadingDegrees` has no zero case — 0° is a real heading — so a dead A380
FCU's zero heading composes an ordinary "Heading 000 degrees" and is kept silent only by the
health-var gate above, never by `Unavailable`. `Unavailable` is recorded like dashes, silently, but
a delivery FROM `Unavailable` (the health var returning, or a source leaving `Unavailable`) begins
a settle: the A380 zeroes every output rather than dashing it, so without this a battery-on read as
nine knob turns at once. A power-DOWN is silent outright (staged phrases are dropped).

**Callouts are STAGED, not spoken on delivery, and released at the batch's end.** Whether a change
is a knob turn depends on the FCU health var of the same sample too, which may sort before or after
the value in its batch (above) — so `AnnounceFcuValue` only records a change; `BaseAircraftDefinition.
OnContinuousBatchDelivered` (fired from `SimConnectManager.ContinuousBatchDelivered`, after every
`SimVarUpdated` that batch message carried) speaks whatever `FcuValueAnnouncer.OnBatchDelivered`
released. That release runs OUTSIDE MainForm's `announcer.Suppressed` wrap (which only wraps
`ProcessSimVarUpdate`), so each airframe checks its own Ctrl+M mute set itself before staging
(`A32NXDisabledMonitorVariablesSet` / `A380DisabledMonitorVariablesSet`) — the same reason the
armed-ALT hold above has to.

**The speak/stay-silent rules (`FcuValueAnnouncer`).** Phrases are compared, not numbers: the
first sample of a key is a silent baseline; a dashed window (null phrase) is recorded but silent,
so pulling back out of managed speaks the value even when it equals the last selection, and a key
first seen dashed still speaks its first selection (an FMS departure). A Ctrl+M mute, and a
readout about to speak the same value, still RECORD the value — skipping the call left a stale
baseline that swallowed a later turn back to the old value. Callouts yield when the shared
announcement queue is backed up.

**Every MSFSBA-origin write arms its echo from ONE table, `FcuEchoKeys.For(evt, sources,
confirmation)`, BEFORE the send.** `FcuConfirmation` says what else already confirms the write, so
the table decides which value vars are left for the dial callout to confirm: `ModeFeedback`
(MainForm's press feedback, `GetButtonStateMapping` — the A32NX's input-mode hotkeys and its
plain-event FCU panel buttons, armed in `HandleHotkeyAction` and the A32NX's `OnPanelButtonFiring`),
`ValueReadout` (a readout is about to speak the value — `FireFCUButton(readback:true)` on either
airframe, and every A380 panel button, whose own `OnPanelButtonFiring` arms it unconditionally),
and `None` (nothing else confirms the write, so the callout must — the `SetFCU*Value` methods' own
readback, `SetTrkFpaMode`, and `FireFCUButton(readback:false)`). V/S push/pull get special
treatment: nothing announces a V/S level-off on its own (the FMA stays V/S), so `FcuEchoKeys.For`
only mutes the vertical channel for those two events under `ValueReadout` — otherwise (`None`/
`ModeFeedback`) it leaves them unmuted so the dial's own batch-released callout confirms the
level-off. `MainForm` calls `OnPanelButtonFiring` on every panel Event-type button BEFORE its event
is sent, so an echo armed there can never lose the race to the sim's answer.

**A dotted A32NX event queued behind the calc-path probe re-arms its echo when it is finally
sent.** `SendEvent` can hold a dotted/`H:` event for the probe's whole run (`CalcPathVerdict`, up
to ~60 s) — long past the 2.5 s window the call site armed. `SimConnectManager.
QueuedEventDispatched` fires from `FlushPendingCalcEvents`, and the base `OnQueuedEventDispatched`
restarts that event's echo window (`FcuValueAnnouncer.RearmEcho`) the moment it actually reaches
the sim.

**After a context reset** — a reconnect (`OnVariableCacheCleared`, called right after
`OnSimContextReset`), a flight load, or an Aircraft-menu switch made within 60 s of
`AircraftLoaded` (`MainForm.AircraftLoadSettleWindowMs`, a judgement value with no captured timing)
— changes are absorbed until an FCU value the AIRCRAFT publishes has moved and then five
first-batch deliveries pass quietly, or thirty pass regardless (the MD-11's `Md11SeedGate`
numbers). A reconnect's re-fire of every cached var IS that evidence (`refireIsEvidence`), so a
reconnect settle ends in about 5-6 batches, not thirty; a flight load still waits for a genuinely
NEW value — a stock SimVar source (the A380's `FCU_ALT_VALUE`) moving is not that evidence, since
the sim core can restore it from the flight file before the FBW WASM has run, though it still
restarts the quiet count. The baselines are kept, never wiped: a value the load leaves alone is
never re-delivered, and a wiped baseline would take the pilot's first turn as its silent seed.
Accepted residual: the settle only guarantees the FIRST burst of power-up churn is absorbed — a
LATER transient, such as the FMGC's own AP-engage self-test pulse (on the order of 25 s), can
arrive after the settle has already ended on ordinary evidence and is spoken like a real knob turn.

**The A380's readouts (Shift+H/S/V) and FCU panel buttons now say "managed"/"not available"
instead of a live value.** Reading the display values while dashed spoke a live heading/airspeed
(and, on the A380, a vertical speed of 0) as though it were selected. `FcuWindowStateOf(key)`
(`BaseAircraftDefinition`, reading `FcuValueAnnouncer`'s own recorded state) answers
Dashes/Value/Unavailable for a readout to render, and every A380 Shift+H/S/V branch and
`FireFCUButton`'s value readback go through it; each also arms `SuppressFcuValueChangeEcho` for the
var it is about to speak, so the same value arriving with the next batch is not spoken twice. On
the A32NX the readouts instead mute the matching dial source WHILE their own pending flag
(`isRequestingHeading` etc.) is set (`readoutPending` in `ProcessSimVarUpdate`) and still compose
their own words via `Compose{Heading,Speed,Altitude,Vertical}Readout` — same result (no double
speech, "managed"/"not available" instead of a live number), reached by muting the callout rather
than asking the callout's own tracker for the words.

**A32NX/A330 FCU panel number fields go through the same setters and validation as the FCU
windows.** `HandleUIVariableSet`'s `A32NX.FCU_{HDG,SPD,ALT}_SET` branches now call
`FcuValueEntry.Try{Heading,Speed,Altitude}` and the matching `SetFCU*Value` directly, and
`return true` (handled) instead of falling through to the generic panel path — which sent
`(uint)value`, truncating a typed Mach (0.78 → 0) and snapping an altitude to its 1000-ft
increment, and spoke "<name> set to <value>" for whatever was typed rather than what actually
reached the aircraft. `FcuValueEntry` (a new pure class, `FcuValueEntryTests`) is the one place
both the panel fields and `FBWA320{Heading,Speed,Altitude}Window` validate a typed value and
encode it (Mach travels ×100), so an out-of-range entry reads the same error either way.

**The heading window's TRK/FPA label reads the batch, not a poll.** `A32NX_TRK_FPA_MODE_ACTIVE`
itself stays OnRequest on the A32NX — streaming it as announced spoke every panel TRK/FPA press
twice (the press feedback plus the generic monitor) — but FBW mirrors the same value into
`A32NX_FCU_AFS_DISPLAY_TRK_FPA_MODE`, which the hardware-dial announcer already streams in the
batch and consumes silently (`ExcludeFromMonitorManager`, never spoken). `FBWA320HeadingWindow`'s
500 ms label timer now just reads that cache instead of calling `RequestVariable` on a timer
(`RequestTrkMode` is gone). The A380's Ctrl+H window never polled: `A32NX_TRK_FPA_MODE_ACTIVE`
streams there on its own per-var subscription (Continuous + `ExcludeFromBatch`), and the window's
timer only reads the cache that subscription feeds — through the definition's commanded-or-cached
view (`TrkFpaModeCommandedOrCached`), so a mode just pressed shows, and a quick second press asks
for the other mode, before the sim confirms the first.

**The five streamed A32NX value vars carry `FCU … Value` `DisplayName`s** (`FCU Heading Value`,
not `Selected Heading`) so a Ctrl+M search for "heading" does not surface a row named with the
exact words the MANAGED/SELECTED mode callout speaks — muting THAT row silenced the mode feedback
instead of the dial callout it looked like it would mute. Pinned by
`A32nx_callout_mute_rows_never_read_like_a_mode_callout`. The A380's equivalent rows still carry
their older `Selected …` names — unreviewed for the same collision.

### Fenix A320 AI display reads — the camera indices are MEASURED (2026-09-21)

Five reads, a table of `Aircraft/AiDisplayRead.cs` in `Aircraft/FenixA320DisplayReads.cs`,
dispatched by `BaseAircraftDefinition.HandleHotkeyAction` from the definition's `DisplayReads`
override. The app moves the simulator camera to the view that frames the display, captures with
`PrintWindow`, puts the camera back, and only then makes the AI call.

| Key | Display | Instrument view |
|---|---|---|
| Alt+P | PFD (the FIRST OFFICER'S) | view 9 (index 8) |
| Alt+N | ND (the CAPTAIN'S) | view 8 (index 7) |
| Alt+E | E/WD | view 8 (index 7) |
| Alt+S | SD | view 8 (index 7) |
| Alt+I | Standby instruments | view 8 (index 7) |

**Measured on the live aircraft** (MSFS 2024 1.8.16.0, FenixA320 IAE WF) by writing each index and
capturing the frame. On this aircraft `cameras.cfg` is wrong TWICE over, so do not "correct" the
table from it:

- The titles mislead, as always. The camera framing the CENTRE panel is titled "Main Panel (Left)"
  and the one framing the FIRST OFFICER'S side is titled "Main Panel (Center)".
- ⚠️ **The live index is not the camera's position in the file.** File position 7,
  "Main Panel (Left)" — the captain's side — is absent from the live list entirely, so every
  camera after it shifts down one. `CAMERA VIEW TYPE AND INDEX MAX:2` reads 18 for 18 usable
  views, 0..17 (writing 18 is refused), which is exactly the 19 definitions minus the missing one.
  Live index 9 is the upper overhead and 10 the rear circuit-breaker wall, not main-panel views.

⚠️ **The camera list is in `common/config/cameras.cfg`** (84 KB). All four presets — CFM_SL,
CFM_WF, IAE_SL, IAE_WF — are 45-byte `[MODULAR_MERGE] auto = true` stubs. That is the OPPOSITE of
the PMDG 737-800 layout (per-livery-preset files, `common` a stub) and the same as the PMDG 737-900,
so one measurement covers every Fenix variant.

**The captain's PFD cannot be read, and Alt+N deliberately does not match Alt+P's side.** No live
view frames the captain's PFD: the centre view clips BOTH PFDs to slivers at its edges, and the
only view holding a whole PFD is the first officer's. The ND is the display where the side
genuinely matters, because range and mode are set per side (`S_FCU_EFIS1_ND_MODE` /
`S_FCU_EFIS2_ND_MODE`), so Alt+N reads the captain's; a PFD differs between sides only in the
altimeter setting and in side-specific FD/AP annunciation. Owner's ruling, 2026-09-21.

**Two prompts are Fenix-specific and must not be folded back into the shared ones.**
`DisplayType.NDFenix` exists because the centre view frames BOTH NDs and the shared
`DisplayType.ND` prompt says only "ONLY describe the Navigation Display" — ambiguous with two side
by side — so it names the left-hand one. `DisplayType.StandbyFenix` exists because Fenix ships
BOTH kinds of standby: this airframe has three round dial gauges (airspeed, altimeter with a
Kollsman baro window, attitude) plus a DME/VOR indicator, other variants a single digital ISIS.
The prompt identifies which is fitted and reports it, the way the PMDG 737's lower-DU prompt names
which of its two pages it found. `DisplayType.ISIS` is shared with the HorizonSim 787, which has a
real digital ISFD, so it could not be edited in place. A digital ISIS occupies the same panel
location as the round gauges, so view 8 serves both.

⚠️ The old hotkey-guide line said the ISIS needs "default camera view 9". That is wrong: view 9
(index 8) holds the first officer's ND and PFD with the ECAM clipped at its left edge, and no
standby instruments at all. The standby is in view 8 (index 7), measured.
