# Weather (ActiveSky integration, SimConnect fallbacks, METAR)

Weather in MSFS Blind Assist comes from three sources, never blended per-field: **SimConnect**
(`AMBIENT_*` SimVars, always available, source of truth when ActiveSky is off), **HiFi
ActiveSky's local HTTP API** (opt-in, source of truth for wind/precip/turbulence when it's
running), and **VATSIM's public METAR feed** (always-on, independent of both — the METAR
report window's primary source). This doc covers the ActiveSky opt-in gate, the four places
that must keep working with ActiveSky off, wind and precipitation source precedence, the
decoded-weather monitor's lifecycle, and two standing implementation gotchas.

**Key files:**
- `Services/ActiveSkyClient.cs` — HTTP client for the AS local API; owns the central opt-in gate
- `Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs` — background poller that speaks "Weather update…"
- `Services/ActiveSkyFormatting.cs` — pure text builders for the ActiveSky read-only surfaces
  (mode line, temp/dew line, forecast presets, Winds Aloft altitude window, vertical-profile
  narrative) — no I/O, fully characterization-tested
- `Services/ActiveSkyModeTracker.cs` — pure baseline-first decision logic for the mode-change
  announcement
- `Services/RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker.cs` — pure per-key zone state machine for the en-route
  advisory proximity announcements (§12)
- `Services/TurnaroundLiftoffDetector.cs` — pure touchdown+dwell+liftoff detector that fires the
  third reset trigger on the proximity tracker (§12d)
- `MainForm.Announcers.cs` — output+I wind (`RequestWindInfo`), the ambient auto-announce
  (`CheckAmbientWeatherChanges` / `AnnounceAmbientChanges`)
- `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs` — the on-demand weather radar/briefing window
- `Forms/METARReportForm.cs` — the ICAO METAR lookup window (VATSIM + optional AS section)
- `Settings/UserSettings.cs` — `ActiveSkyEnabled`, `WeatherAutoAnnounceEnabled`,
  `WeatherAutoAnnounceIntervalMinutes`
- `Forms/Settings/WeatherPanel.cs` — the Weather settings tab

## 1. ActiveSky integration is opt-in

`UserSettings.ActiveSkyEnabled` (Weather settings tab, default `false`) is the master switch
for all ActiveSky code. The gate is centralized at the top of
`ActiveSkyClient.IsRunningAsync()`:

```csharp
if (!Settings.SettingsManager.Current.ActiveSkyEnabled)
{
    LastSuccessfulPort = null;
    LastStatus = "disabled in settings";
    return false;
}
```

Nulling `LastSuccessfulPort` here closes an enable → discover → disable leak: without it, a
cached port from a previous enabled session would silently outlive the user turning the
switch off. The five data methods (`GetCurrentConditionsAsync`, `GetWeatherAreaAsync`,
`GetPositionMetarAsync`, `GetClosestStationMetarAsync`, `GetMetarAsync`) each carry their own
`if (!Settings.SettingsManager.Current.ActiveSkyEnabled) return null;` guard as defense in
depth, in case a future call site skips the `IsRunningAsync()` liveness check.

Why the switch exists at all: `IsRunningAsync()`'s parallel port probe
(`CandidatePortList = { 19285, 19286, 19287 }`) has a `ProbeTimeout` of 1.2 seconds. When AS
isn't installed, every candidate probe times out — so before the switch existed, every
non-AS user paid up to ~1.2 s on every output+I press, every radar refresh, and every 60 s
monitor poll. With the switch off, `IsRunningAsync()` returns `false` **instantly** — no probe
is ever attempted.

## 2. SimConnect remains the weather source when the switch is off

This is the invariant the whole feature rests on. Three of the four weather-reading paths
fall back to SimConnect when `ActiveSkyEnabled == false`; the fourth (the METAR report form)
never used SimConnect at all — its always-on primary source is VATSIM, not SimConnect (the
code contradicts a looser "SimConnect on all four paths" framing; see the note after the
table).

| Path | File / method | With the switch off |
|---|---|---|
| output+I wind | `MainForm.Announcers.cs` `RequestWindInfo` → `TryGetActiveSkyConditionsAsync` | `TryGetActiveSkyConditionsAsync` awaits `weatherActiveSky.IsRunningAsync()`, which returns `false` at the gate, so it returns `null`. The `else` branch calls `simConnectManager.RequestWindInfo(...)` → `FormatWindData`. `sourceNotice` ("ActiveSky not responding…") stays empty because it's only set when `ActiveSkyEnabled` is true. |
| Cloud / precipitation / visibility auto-announce | `MainForm.Announcers.cs` `CheckAmbientWeatherChanges` → `AnnounceAmbientChanges` | SimConnect ambient (`simConnectManager.RequestWeatherInfo`) is fetched **unconditionally, first** — every call, AS on or off. `asPrecip` stays `null` (the AS block is skipped when `IsRunningAsync()` returns false), so `AnnounceAmbientChanges` takes the SimConnect `PrecipState`/`PrecipRate` branch. Cloud entry/exit and visibility crossings are **always** SimConnect-sourced in either branch — AS's API doesn't expose in-cloud or a precip bitmask at all. |
| Weather Radar | `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs` `FetchAmbientAsync` | SimConnect ambient (`_simConnect.RequestWeatherInfo`) is fetched unconditionally, same as above. `_activeSkyAvailable == false` (set once per `RefreshAsync` from `IsRunningAsync()`) skips the whole AS block, and the method returns `WeatherService.FormatAmbientWeather(simData)` — fully SimConnect. |
| METAR report form (Shift+M-style lookup) | `Forms/METARReportForm.cs` `FetchMETAR` | `asAvailable` (checked once on `Load`) is `false`, so the AS section (`asMetarLabel`/`asMetarTextBox`) never becomes visible and the form stays at its compact 400 px size. The **only** METAR fetched is `VATSIMService.GetMETARAsync(icao)` — this path was never SimConnect, on or off. |

## 3. Wind truth is per-engine

With the switch **on**, output+I reads ActiveSky's ambient wind (`FormatActiveSkyWind` in
`MainForm.Announcers.cs`, reading `Conditions.AmbientWindDirection` / `AmbientWindSpeed`).
The `SurfaceGustSpeed` suffix ("… gusting N") is appended **only when the aircraft is on the
ground** (`_lastOnGround`): AS's `Ambient*` and `Surface*` field groups are independent
quantities — at-altitude vs ground level below the aircraft — so airborne the surface gust
does not belong to the ambient wind being read out (at FL360 it produced "061 at 11 gusting
21", the cruise wind glued to the ground gust six miles below — the 2026-07 fix). The
destination half of the same announcement speaks the gust from the destination METAR's wind
group (`VATSIMService.ParseMETARWind` captures `G##`), which is where an approach-relevant
gust actually comes from. The same parser handles two edge cases in that wind group
(2026-07-13 fix): a METAR reporting speed in metres per second (`24004MPS`, common outside the
US/UK) has its direction/speed AND gust converted to knots (`× 1.94384`, rounded) instead of
silently failing the wind match entirely — the old regex only recognized `KT`; and `G//`
(some stations' convention for an unmeasurable/estimated gust) degrades to "no gust" rather
than failing the whole match, so the base direction/speed still comes through even when the
gust figure itself is unusable. With the switch **off**, SimConnect is authoritative and correct —
full stop.

The two sources can legitimately diverge: AS applies its own wind smoothing/interpolation, so
its ambient wind is not guaranteed to match SimConnect's `AMBIENT WIND DIRECTION`/`VELOCITY`
at the same instant. Neither is "the" truth for both populations — never hard-pick one source
for users who haven't opted into ActiveSky, and never silently fall back to SimConnect for
users who have (that's exactly the "ActiveSky not responding" notice's job — Robin's ruling,
recorded in `docs/design/2026-07-09-activesky-switch-review-fixes-design.md` §D5: the notice
fires on every press when AS is enabled but unreachable, deliberately, because a blind pilot
must never miss a degraded wind readout).

The same per-engine rule extends to the Weather Radar form's Winds Aloft box
(`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs` `FetchWindsAloftAsync`). With the switch **on** and AS reachable
(`_activeSkyAvailable == true`), the box calls `ActiveSkyClient.GetAtmosphereAsync` for
sim-truth wind and temperature at each level; if that call comes back empty (AS answered the
earlier liveness probe but this particular endpoint call didn't), the method falls through to
the unchanged Open-Meteo path (`WeatherService.GetWindsAloftAsync`) rather than failing the box
outright. With the switch **off**, Open-Meteo is used directly, exactly as before. Both paths
end with a visible source tag line — `"Source: ActiveSky"` (`ActiveSkyFormatting.
BuildWindsAloftText`) or `"Source: Open-Meteo"` — so the reader always knows which engine
answered. The header line above the level table is worded honestly per source rather than
shared text (2026-07-13 fix): `BuildWindsAloftText` reads `"Aircraft: {alt} ft | current
winds:"` — it's a live AS query, sim-truth for right now — while the Open-Meteo builder
(`WeatherRadarForm.FetchWindsAloftAsync`) keeps `"… | forecast winds:"`, because Open-Meteo
genuinely is a forecast model, not an observation; calling AS's data "forecast" would have been
dishonest about what the pilot is hearing. The altitude window itself — ±5,000 ft of the
aircraft in 1,000-ft steps, clamped at 0 — must stay identical between the two sources, and as
of 2026-07-13 that's enforced structurally rather than by convention: `WeatherService.
ParseWindsAloft` (the Open-Meteo path, `Services/WeatherService.cs`) now CALLS the single shared
`ActiveSkyFormatting.WindsAloftAltitudes` (`Services/ActiveSkyFormatting.cs`) instead of
recomputing its own copy of the ±5,000/1,000-ft-step math, so switching source never changes
which levels the pilot hears — only who answered for them — and the two windows can no longer
drift apart by editing one copy and forgetting the other. Never reintroduce an inline copy of
this window in either path.

## 4. Precipitation source precedence

Three separate readouts decode precipitation from a METAR: the Weather Radar
(`WeatherRadarForm.ParsePrecipFromMetar`), the ActiveSky decoded-weather monitor
(`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor` via the `WeatherRadarFormPrecipShim` copy — see §7), and the
ambient auto-announce (`MainForm.Announcers.cs` `CheckAmbientWeatherChanges`). They do **not**
all share one tier count — each has a different number of fallback steps — but they all obey
the same underlying rule: **prefer the closest-station METAR before the position METAR**, so
that when both a closest-station report and a position report exist, all three readouts pick
the same one and never contradict each other.

**Weather Radar** (`WeatherRadarForm.FormatAmbientFromActiveSky`, `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`)
has four tiers:

1. Closest-station METAR (`ActiveSkyClient.GetClosestStationMetarAsync`) — the real nearest
   reporting station.
2. The conditions-JSON `ClosestMetar` field — a second, belt-and-braces attempt at the same
   closest-station report when the dedicated endpoint call in tier 1 came back empty, before
   the radar gives up on "closest station" entirely.
3. Position METAR (`GetPositionMetarAsync`, AS's `@POS` interpolated point weather) —
   fallback when both closest-station attempts fail.
4. SimConnect `AMBIENT_PRECIP_STATE`/`AMBIENT_PRECIP_RATE` bitmask — last resort, only reached
   when ActiveSky isn't running at all (see §2's table; under ActiveSky the bitmask is known
   to stick, e.g. reported stuck on "extreme snow").

**Alt+W ambient auto-announce** (`MainForm.Announcers.cs`, `CheckAmbientWeatherChanges` /
`AnnounceAmbientChanges`) has three tiers: closest-station METAR, then (if that's empty)
position METAR, then — only if AS isn't running or both METAR fetches came back empty, leaving
`asPrecip == null` — the same SimConnect bitmask branch.

**The decoded-weather monitor** (`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.BuildAnnouncement`) has only **two**
tiers and no SimConnect branch at all: closest-station METAR, else position METAR. There is no
third tier here and there cannot be one — `OnTickAsync` early-returns before `BuildAnnouncement`
is ever called, both when ActiveSky isn't running (§5) and when the position METAR fetch itself
came back empty, so the monitor never reaches a state where it would need to fall back past
"position METAR." When ActiveSky isn't running, the monitor doesn't announce a SimConnect-
sourced precip line — it stays silent and resets its baseline (§5). This matches §5 below: there
is no SimConnect fallback for decoded station weather.

The weather invariant [WX-5] ([invariants/weather.md](invariants/weather.md)) states this as three tiers (closest-station METAR → position
METAR → SimConnect bitmask). That's a simplification aimed at the general "prefer closest
station" rule, not a literal count for every readout: it's exact for the ambient auto-announce;
for the Weather Radar it collapses tiers 1 and 2 into one "closest-station METAR" step; and for
the decoded-weather monitor the third (SimConnect) tier doesn't exist — the monitor's fallback
chain stops at position METAR.

A METAR that parses with **no** weather-phenomenon token means "no precipitation" and must
render as `"None"` — it must never fall through to the next source in the list. Only a
wholly-missing METAR (the fetch itself failed or returned empty/whitespace) triggers
fallback to the next source. `WeatherRadarForm.FormatAmbientFromActiveSky` implements this
exactly: each of its three METAR-based branches does
`string.IsNullOrEmpty(parsed) ? "None" : parsed` — never `continue`/fall-through on an empty
parse.

## 5. The decoded-weather monitor lifecycle

`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor` (the background poller that speaks *"Active sky weather updated…"*)
is constructed unconditionally in `MainForm.InitializeManagers`, so the settings dialog can
start or stop it live without reconstructing it. Whether it actually polls is governed by one
static predicate, `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.ShouldRun`:

```csharp
public static bool ShouldRun(Settings.UserSettings settings)
    => settings.ActiveSkyEnabled && settings.WeatherAutoAnnounceEnabled;
```

Both flags are required because the monitor is simultaneously an ActiveSky feature (it reads
only the AS HTTP API — there is **no** SimConnect fallback for decoded station weather; if AS
isn't running, the tick just resets its baseline and returns) and an announcement feature (it
speaks unprompted). `ShouldRun` has three call sites, not one. Two gate the monitor's own
`Enabled` state: `MainForm.InitializeManagers` at launch
(`activeSkyWeatherMonitor.Enabled = ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.ShouldRun(...)`, `MainForm.cs:602`)
and `MainForm.MenuHandlers.ApplyRuntimeSettings` on live settings save
(`MainForm.MenuHandlers.cs:113`). The third, `WeatherPanel.UpdateActiveSkyDependentVisibility`
(`Forms/Settings/WeatherPanel.cs:61`), gates something different — not the monitor's `Enabled`
flag, but whether the announcement-interval combo is visible and in the NVDA tab order. It
builds a throwaway `UserSettings` from the two live checkbox states (the panel has no
committed `UserSettings` at `CheckedChanged` time) and calls `ShouldRun` on it, because a
setting that governs nothing shouldn't be reachable by a blind user tabbing the panel. All
three call `ShouldRun` rather than restating `enabled && autoAnnounce` inline, so the
both-flags rule has exactly one definition and none of the three sites can drift from it.

`CheckAmbientWeatherChanges` (§2's cloud/precip/visibility auto-announce) is a **different**
feature on a **different** timer (`weatherAnnouncementTimer`, ticked from
`WeatherAnnouncementTimer_Tick`), gated on `WeatherAutoAnnounceEnabled` alone — it doesn't
consult `ActiveSkyEnabled` at all, because it always has a SimConnect fallback path (§2).
Don't confuse the two: a user can have ambient cloud/precip/visibility announcements without
ever touching ActiveSky, but the decoded-AS-weather monitor needs both switches.

**Known behavior consequence:** an existing user who had spoken weather updates before this
gate change but never ticked "Auto-announce weather state changes" will go silent after
upgrading. That's the intended decoupling (the AS switch alone must never start the spoken
weather updates), not a regression.

That invariant is scoped to the `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor`'s decoded-weather updates
(`ShouldRun`, above) — it does not extend to every AS-gated announcer. The route-advisory
announce (§12d) is DELIBERATELY independent of the "Auto-announce weather state changes" master
(spec 2026-07-12 §5) and is gated on its own default-on sub-toggle
(`AnnounceRouteAdvisoriesEnabled`) plus the AS switch alone, the same shape as the SIGMET/PIREP
proximity toggles it sits beside. Do not "fix" it onto the master gate — that would be reverting
a deliberate design choice, not correcting a bug.

## 6. The no-repeat rule for the precip auto-announce

`AnnounceAmbientChanges`'s ActiveSky branch must not repeat an unchanged phrase. It compares
the decoded precip phrase **trimmed and case-insensitive**:

```csharp
string cur = asPrecip.Trim();
if (_prevAsPrecip != null && !string.Equals(cur, _prevAsPrecip, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
    ...
}
```

It speaks only on a genuine start (`""` → non-empty: `"Precipitation started: {cur}"`), a
genuine stop (non-empty → `""`: `"Precipitation stopped"`), or a genuinely different phrase
(`"Precipitation now {cur}"`). An unchanged phrase — e.g. `"light rain"` → `"light rain"` —
stays silent even though the poll fired. The SimConnect (non-AS) branch uses a parallel but
distinct mechanism: `IntensityTier(rate)` buckets the continuous `PrecipRate` into
light/moderate/heavy/extreme and only announces on a tier change, since the raw SimConnect
rate never repeats byte-for-byte the way a decoded METAR phrase can.

## 7. The decoder duplication

`WeatherRadarForm.ParsePrecipFromMetar` (internal static, `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`) is the
canonical WMO/ICAO weather-token decoder — it walks METAR tokens for intensity prefix
(`-`/`+`/`VC`), descriptor (`TS`/`SH`/`FZ`/`BL`/`DR`/`MI`/`BC`/`PR`), and phenomenon
(`RA`/`SN`/`GR`/`GS`/`PL`/`IC`/`UP`/`DZ`/`SG`), and renders e.g. `"light rain"` or
`"thunderstorm with heavy rain"`.

`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor` (namespace `MSFSBlindAssist.Services`) doesn't call it directly.
The obstacle isn't access level — `ParsePrecipFromMetar` is `internal static`
(`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs:444`), which is visible from anywhere in the same assembly,
`Services` included. The obstacle is layering: `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs` already
`using`s `MSFSBlindAssist.Services`, so a `Services` class calling back into a `Forms` class
would create a `Services → Forms` dependency the codebase doesn't want alongside the existing
`Forms → Services` one. So `Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs` hosts a byte-for-byte
duplicate as `WeatherRadarFormPrecipShim.ParsePrecipFromMetar` — same token classification,
same output strings. **Do not move the decoder out of `WeatherRadarForm` without updating the
shim**, and do not change one copy's phenomenon/descriptor table without mirroring the change
in the other — a drift here would make the radar, the decoded-weather monitor, and the ambient
auto-announce (which also calls the shim, via `MSFSBlindAssist.Services.WeatherRadarFormPrecipShim`
in `CheckAmbientWeatherChanges`) disagree about the same METAR.

## 8. Two standing gotchas

- **Never scan `%APPDATA%\HiFi\` for the ActiveSky settings-file port.** `ActiveSkyClient`
  hard-codes `CandidatePortList = { 19285, 19286, 19287 }` and probes them in parallel instead
  of reading AS's settings file for its configured port. Recursive directory enumeration under
  `%APPDATA%\HiFi\` was tried first and caused multi-second UI-thread hangs — AS keeps
  gigabytes of weather logs/history in subdirectories there.
- **Turbulence ≤ 25 is the AS calm-weather baseline and must be hidden entirely, never shown
  as a raw number.** `WeatherRadarForm.CategorizeTurbulence` maps AS's 1–100 turbulence value
  to `null` (suppress the line) at ≤ 25, then `"light"` (26–50), `"moderate"` (51–75),
  `"severe"` (76–90), `"extreme"` (91+) — following FAA AIM 7-1-23 phraseology. AS sits at
  ~25 in genuinely calm conditions as numerical/atmospheric baseline noise; showing "25/100"
  reads as alarming when nothing is actually happening.

## 9. ActiveSky read-only surfaces (2026-07)

Design doc: `docs/design/2026-07-10-activesky-improvements-design.md`. Four read-only additions
on top of the surfaces above — a mode readout, a vertical weather profile, an on-demand
closest-station readout, and a forecast METAR combo — all gated
behind the same `ActiveSkyEnabled` opt-in and, on the Weather Radar form, hidden entirely
(`Visible = false`, out of the NVDA tab order) rather than shown with disabled/placeholder text
when the switch is off.

**(a) Mode status line + mode-change announce.** `ActiveSkyClient.ProbePortAsync` (`Services/
ActiveSkyClient.cs`) — the same GET that already runs for every liveness probe — captures the
`/GetMode` response body for free (zero extra requests), but only the WINNING probe writes it
into `LastModeText` (2026-07-13 fix): `IsRunningAsync`'s parallel candidate-port race fires
`ProbePortAsync` against all three candidate ports at once, and the abandoned tasks for the
losing ports keep running in the background after the caller returns on the first success — if
`ProbePortAsync` itself wrote `LastModeText`, a late 200 from one of those abandoned tasks could
silently overwrite the mode text after the fact with a foreign port's body. `ProbePortAsync` now
just returns the body alongside its success/port/error tuple, and only the call site that
observes the winning result assigns `LastModeText`. `LastModeText` is also nulled in the same two
branches that already null `LastSuccessfulPort` — the disabled-switch guard and the
all-candidates-failed path — closing the same enable→discover→disable leak (§1) for the mode
text: a "Live Real time mode (Active)" string captured while AS was reachable must not survive
AS going away or the switch being turned off. `ActiveSkyFormatting.ParseModeText`
(`Services/ActiveSkyFormatting.cs`) strips the trailing `"(Active)"`/
`"(Inactive)"` marker and the `"(...z)"` weather-clock group out of that raw text; `FormatModeLine`
renders it as `"ActiveSky: Live Real time mode, weather time 1935Z"`. `WeatherRadarForm.
RefreshAsync` (`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`) shows this in `_asModeBox` at the top of the form — a
**read-only TextBox, deliberately not a Label**: labels have no tab stop, so a screen-reader user
could never reach the mode line by keyboard (Robin's 2026-07-11 review finding). It substitutes
`"ActiveSky: {LastStatus}"` when AS is enabled but unreachable, and hides the box entirely when
the switch is off. The write itself goes through `DisplayText.SetPreserveCaret`, not a raw
`Text =` assignment (2026-07-13 fix): the rendered line embeds the AS weather clock
(`weather time 1935Z`), which advances every minute, so a plain reassignment would reset the
NVDA review cursor to position 0 on every clock roll while a user is mid-read of the line — the
same reasoning as the `DisplayListBox` reconciliation in §11, applied to a single-line control.

The *spoken* side is separate: `ActiveSkyModeTracker.Observe` (`Services/
ActiveSkyModeTracker.cs`) is pure decision logic wired into `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.OnTickAsync`
(`Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs`) and follows four rules. **Baseline-first** — the first
successful `Observe` call only records `_baselineMode` and returns null; nothing is ever spoken
about the mode the app happened to find AS in. **Silent on connect** — because of the
baseline-first rule, launching the app (or AS) never produces a mode announcement, only a later
genuine change does. **The baseline survives unreachable gaps** — when `IsRunningAsync()` fails
mid-tick, `OnTickAsync` resets its OWN change-detection state (`_lastTimeStamp`,
`_hasBaseline`, `_lastAnnouncedAt`) but deliberately does **not** touch `_modeTracker`, so if AS
comes back in a *different* mode than the one last observed, that difference still announces —
a pilot needs to hear that AS restarted into, say, Custom static mode, even though the monitor's
own weather-refresh baseline was wiped by the gap. **Gated by `ShouldRun`** — the mode-change
announce only fires while the monitor is polling at all, i.e. `ActiveSkyEnabled &&
WeatherAutoAnnounceEnabled` (§5); with auto-announce off, the mode is still readable on demand
via the Weather Radar form's status line, just never spoken unprompted.

**(b) Closest-station box shares one code path with the auto-announce.** `WeatherRadarForm.
FetchAmbientAsync` (`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`) populates `_stationBox` by calling
`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.BuildDecodedWeatherText` (`Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs`) —
the exact same internal static that `BuildAnnouncement` calls to build the *"Active sky weather
updated…"* auto-announce — with the raw METAR appended underneath. There is deliberately no
second decoder: on-demand and unprompted readouts of the same station must say the same thing
in the same words, and any wording change to `BuildDecodedWeatherText` reaches both surfaces at
once rather than needing to be kept in sync by hand (unlike the precipitation-token decoder in
§7, which genuinely does have to be duplicated for layering reasons — this one doesn't, because
both callers already live in `Services`).

**Current-position temperature/dew point line (a related read-only addition, sharing the
decoder used in (b)).** `ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildTempDewLine` (`Services/
ActiveSkyFormatting.cs`) decodes the already-fetched position METAR into `"Temperature/dew
point: 36 / 12°C"`, appended to `WeatherRadarForm.FormatAmbientFromActiveSky`'s current-position
block (`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`) — the dew point has no other source anywhere in the app (no
SimConnect dew-point SimVar, no dew field in the AS JSON conditions block). `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor
.DecodeMetar` (`Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs`) yields temperature and dew point strictly
together — both-or-neither, since a METAR reports them as one `TT/DD` group token — so
`BuildTempDewLine` renders the line only when **both** `TemperatureC` and `DewPointC` are
present, and returns null (no line at all) otherwise. The original design doc's
"dew point missing from the METAR → the line shows temperature only" fallback was proven
unreachable during implementation — the decoder never produces temperature without dew point —
and was deliberately not built (see the implementation note appended to `docs/design/
2026-07-10-activesky-improvements-design.md` §4.1 item 2).

**(c) Vertical profile: enum conventions and curation.** `ActiveSkyClient.GetWeatherInfoXmlAsync`
/ `ParseWeatherInfoXml` (`Services/ActiveSkyClient.cs`) parse `/GetWeatherInfoXml` into a
`VerticalProfile` of `ProfileWindLayer`/`ProfileCloudLayer` records. Three enum conventions to
remember when touching this code: **severity is 0-4** (FSX-style: 1 light, 2 moderate, 3 heavy,
4 severe; 0/unknown = no phrase) for `TurbulenceEnum` and `IcingEnum` on both layer types — this
is a *different* scale from the JSON `Conditions.AmbientTurbulence` 0-100 value used elsewhere
in the file, so `ActiveSkyFormatting.SeverityWord` must never be fed a 0-100 number or vice
versa; **cloud coverage is oktas** (1-2 few, 3-4 scattered, 5-7 broken, 8 overcast; anything
else is not a reportable layer), decoded by `CoverageWord`; **metres→feet conversion applies
only to cloud base/top** (`ParseWeatherInfoXml` converts `CloudBaseMeters`/`CloudTopMeters` ×
3.28084 at parse time) — wind-layer altitudes arrive from the XML's `AltFeet` attribute already
in feet and must not be converted again. `PrecipWord` maps `PrecipType` 0/1/2 to none/rain/snow.

`ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildProfileNarrative` assembles the spoken text: every cloud layer with
base/top/coverage, plus icing/precip/turbulence phrases only when present, ordered by base
altitude ascending; then winds/temps at the layer nearest each of six standard levels (surface,
5,000, 10,000, 18,000, 24,000, 34,000 ft) **plus** the layer nearest the aircraft's current
altitude, deduplicated and re-sorted ascending by `SelectCuratedLevels` — a full 13-layer dump
would bury the levels that actually matter to the pilot in ones that don't. `WeatherRadarForm.
FetchProfileAsync` (`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`) is AS-only by construction: it returns
`"unavailable"` immediately when `_activeSkyAvailable != true`, with no SimConnect fallback —
there is no vertical-profile data source outside ActiveSky.

Two 2026-07-13 review fixes tighten the edge cases here. **A well-formed but windless response
reads "unavailable," never a positive "no cloud layers" claim**: a genuine `/GetWeatherInfoXml`
response always carries the full 13-level wind ladder (live-verified 2026-07-13), so a parsed
`VerticalProfile` with zero wind layers is schema-drifted or empty, not a real answer.
`ActiveSkyFormatting.ProfileLooksValid` (`p.WindLayers.Count > 0`) gates `FetchProfileAsync`
alongside the existing `profile == null` check, so that case now also short-circuits to
`"unavailable"` instead of falling through into `BuildProfileNarrative`, which would otherwise
render a reassuring-sounding "No cloud layers" line for a response that never actually answered.
**A cloud layer carrying a hazard phrase is never dropped for an out-of-vocabulary Coverage
value**: the "cloud coverage is oktas" rule above (1-2 few, 3-4 scattered, 5-7 broken, 8
overcast) still governs `CoverageWord`, but a layer whose `CoverageOktas` falls outside that
range is no longer excluded outright — if it carries an icing, precip, or turbulence phrase it
still renders, as `"Unknown coverage, {base} to {top} feet, {hazard}"`, because dropping a
severe-icing layer over a bad Coverage byte would hide the one thing the briefing exists to say.
A layer with neither a recognizable coverage nor any hazard phrase stays dropped exactly as
before, and an empty cloud-layer list after filtering still renders `"No cloud layers"`.

**(d) Forecast combo.** `ActiveSkyFormatting.ForecastPresets` (`Services/
ActiveSkyFormatting.cs`) is the fixed offset table — a full hourly ladder, Now through
+6 hours, i.e. 0/3600/7200/10800/14400/18000/21600 seconds — consumed both to populate `METARReportForm`'s
`forecastCombo` (`Forms/METARReportForm.cs`) and, as the `timeoffset` argument
to `ActiveSkyClient.GetMetarAsync`. The combo sits BELOW the AS METAR box, last in the tab order
before Close (Robin's 2026-07-12 review), so Tab/Shift+Tab hops directly between the AS text
and the offset selector. `BuildAsMetarCaption` renders the AS METAR box's label so it
always states which offset is showing — `"ActiveSky METAR:"` at the `Now` preset,
`"ActiveSky METAR (+4 hours):"` otherwise — so a screen-reader user tabbing between the label
and the box never has to guess which forecast they're reading; `BuildAsMetarAccessibleName`
puts the same fact into the box's own `AccessibleName` (`"ActiveSky METAR, +2 hours"`,
2026-07-13 fix) since a Label's caption text is invisible to a screen reader that has focused the
box itself rather than the label preceding it — a blind pilot arrowing straight to the box with
no label read gets the offset either way. The **VATSIM box is always
current**: `FetchMETAR`'s `vatsimTask` calls `VATSIMService.GetMETARAsync(icao)` with no offset
parameter at all, regardless of the combo's selection — VATSIM has no forecast concept, and the
combo only ever parameterizes the AS fetch. Both the forecast combo and the AS METAR section
share one visibility flag (`asMetarTextBox.Visible`, set once on `Load` from
`_activeSky.IsRunningAsync()`), so when AS is off or unreachable at open time the form reverts
to its original compact VATSIM-only layout.

`RefreshAsMetarAsync` (`Forms/METARReportForm.cs`) is the SINGLE writer of the AS METAR
box/caption/AccessibleName (2026-07-13, two fix passes) — called both from the combo's
`SelectedIndexChanged` (an AS-only refetch: it never re-hits VATSIM and never disables
`icaoTextBox`, since WinForms yanks focus off a disabled control) and from `FetchMETAR`'s
Enter-key full fetch, which now delegates its entire AS leg to it rather than fetching AS
inline. A single-flight `_asFetching` latch plus an `_asPending` replay flag means a combo step
(or a second Enter-key fetch) landing while an AS fetch is already in flight is REPLAYED, never
dropped: the internal `do`/`while` loop re-reads the LIVE `forecastCombo.SelectedIndex` on each
iteration, so the box, its caption, and its `AccessibleName` always converge on wherever the
combo ends up resting, not wherever it was when the fetch started. This also closes a race the
first fix pass left open: because `FetchMETAR` originally fetched AS inline instead of through
the latch, a slower pre-existing combo-triggered fetch could land its stale write AFTER a newer
full-fetch write — routing both call sites through the one latch means overlapping fetches
always self-serialize and the box can never end up mislabeled by a stale concurrent write.

A fifth surface — an `ActiveSkyClient.LastStatus` line in the Weather settings panel — shipped
on this branch and was then REMOVED on Robin's 2026-07-13 review: a connection-status readout
doesn't belong in the settings panel at all. `LastStatus` remains surfaced where it is useful:
the Weather Radar form's mode box shows `"ActiveSky: {LastStatus}"` whenever AS is enabled but
unreachable (§9a). Don't re-add a status line to `WeatherPanel` — the panel is deliberately
pure over its `LoadFrom`/`ApplyTo` arguments (no `SettingsManager.Current` reads, no probes),
which also keeps `WeatherPanelTests` hermetic with no shared-state collection.

## 10. Hazard announcements: turbulence and icing (2026-07)

Design doc: `docs/design/2026-07-11-hazard-announcements-design.md`. Two new unprompted
announcers ride the existing 60-second `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor` tick and the existing
30-second ambient tick respectively — no new poll loops, no new HTTP traffic. Both follow the
`ActiveSkyModeTracker` pattern (§9a): an `internal sealed` pure tracker class with a
`string? Observe(...)` method, fully characterization-tested
(`tests/MSFSBlindAssist.Tests/TurbulenceCategoryTrackerTests.cs`,
`IceAccretionTrackerTests.cs`).

**(a) Turbulence — `Services/TurbulenceCategoryTracker.cs`.** Data source is
`Conditions.AmbientTurbulence` (AS's 1–100 value), read once per `ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor
.OnTickAsync` (`Services/ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.cs`) right after the conditions fetch
succeeds — before the weather-refresh/throttle logic, so a category change is never absorbed
by the "unchanged weather" or interval-throttle branches. The observe is also placed BEFORE the
tick's `positionMetar` early-return (2026-07-13 fix): it originally sat after that check, so a
single blank/failed `GetPositionMetarAsync` call — an unrelated fetch that has nothing to do
with turbulence — could silently delay a real category boundary crossing to the next tick;
moving the turbulence observe up decouples it from position-METAR fetch success entirely, since
its only real data dependency is `conditions`. Category boundaries are copied
**verbatim** from the Weather Radar's `CategorizeTurbulence` (§8): ≤25 smooth, ≤50 light, ≤75
moderate, ≤90 severe, >90 extreme — the same FAA AIM 7-1-23 wording, so the spoken category
always matches what the radar form's Turbulence line would show for the same value.

Rising transitions happen **at the boundary** (>25 enters light, >50 enters moderate, …).
Easing requires the value to clear the boundary it's re-crossing by a **5-point** hysteresis
margin, so a value oscillating on a boundary never flaps: light→smooth needs ≤20, moderate→
light needs ≤45, severe→moderate needs ≤70, extreme→severe needs ≤85. All four are concrete
literals in `CategoryWithHysteresis`/`LowerBoundaries`, not a computed percentage — don't
"simplify" them into a single formula.

Four utterance forms, all **words only** — the raw 1–100 number is never spoken, and smooth
(≤25) is never named as a category, matching §8's "hidden entirely" rule for the raw value:

| Transition | Utterance |
|---|---|
| smooth → any category | `"Entering {category} turbulence"` |
| worsening between categories | `"Turbulence now {category}"` |
| easing between categories (not to smooth) | `"Turbulence easing to {category}"` |
| any category → smooth | `"Smooth air"` |

Baseline-first: the first successful `Observe` call only records the starting category and
returns null — nothing is spoken about the turbulence the app happened to find on connect. The
baseline **survives AS-unreachable gaps**: `OnTickAsync`'s early-return path (AS not detected)
resets the monitor's own refresh-detection state but never calls `Reset()` on the turbulence
tracker, so a genuine category change that happened while AS was unreachable still announces
once AS comes back. `Reset()` is called on BOTH aircraft switch
(`MainForm.AircraftSwitch.cs SwitchAircraft`, via `activeSkyWeatherMonitor
?.ResetTurbulenceTracker()`) AND SimConnect reconnect (`OnConnectionStatusChanged`'s Connected
branch, 2026-07-13 fix — the same rationale as the icing tracker's reconnect reset in (b): flight
1 can end in moderate turbulence, and without a reconnect re-baseline flight 2's first calm poll
would announce a phantom "Smooth air" transition) — a stale category from the previous
flight/airframe must not read as a "change" on the new one. Gated on `AnnounceTurbulenceEnabled`, checked per tick (no
`ApplyRuntimeSettings` wiring needed) and — because the data source is AS-only — implicitly on
`ActiveSkyWeatherMonitor.ShouldRun` (§5): with AS off or auto-announce off, the tick that would
call `Observe` never runs at all.

**(b) Icing — `Services/IceAccretionTracker.cs`.** Data source is the stock `STRUCTURAL ICE
PCT` SimVar, engine-independent airframe ice accretion as a 0..1 ratio (not a percent — the
SimConnect unit string is `"percent over 100"`). It's registered as datum 7 on the existing
ambient weather struct (`SimConnectManager.Setup.cs`):

```csharp
sc.AddToDataDefinition(DATA_DEFINITIONS.WEATHER_DATA, "STRUCTURAL ICE PCT", "percent over 100",
    SIMCONNECT_DATATYPE.FLOAT64, 0.0f, (uint)7);
```

landing in `AmbientWeatherData.StructuralIcePct` (`SimConnect/SimConnectManager.cs`) and
arriving on the same 30-second `RequestWeatherInfo` ambient tick §2's table describes — the
same 3-second timeout/null-skip protection against a stalled sim applies, so no separate
polling was added. `AnnounceAmbientChanges` (`MainForm.Announcers.cs`) SKIPS a `NaN` or negative
sample entirely — it does not call `Observe` at all that tick (2026-07-13 fix, superseding an
earlier clamp-to-0 approach): clamping mid-episode would itself have spoken a phantom "Icing
conditions cleared" as the clamped 0 crossed the falling threshold, then re-announced the onset
on the next good sample — a bad read must leave the tracker's hysteresis state untouched, not
manufacture a false clear/re-onset pair.

Thresholds are **copied verbatim from the FBW A380's sim-verified constants**
(`FlyByWireA380Definition.cs`, `ICING_DETECT_RATIO`/`ICING_CLEAR_RATIO`) — 0.05 rising, 0.02
falling, same as the A380's own ice-stick debounce logic
(`FlyByWireA380Definition.SimVarUpdate.cs`). Rising edge (ratio ≥ 0.05 while not already
icing) speaks `"Icing conditions, ice accumulating"`; falling edge (ratio ≤ 0.02 while icing)
speaks `"Icing conditions cleared"`; the 0.02–0.05 band is a dead zone, deliberately not a
single crossing value, so a ratio hovering near the threshold doesn't flap. First sample is
baseline-silenced — an app connecting with ice already on the airframe adopts that state
without announcing it as a "change." `Reset()` fires on both SimConnect connect
(`MainForm.AircraftSwitch.cs OnConnectionStatusChanged`) and aircraft switch (`SwitchAircraft`)
— a reconnect or airframe swap invalidates any accumulated ice state, so the next sample
re-baselines silently rather than announcing a spurious edge.

**(c) The `HasOwnIcingAnnouncer` yield.** The FBW A380 already had a tuned, sim-verified
ice-stick announcer (`FlyByWireA380Definition.SimVarUpdate.cs`, reading
`A32NX_ICING_STATE_ICING_STICK_INDICATOR` with the same 0.05/0.02 hysteresis, speaking
`"Icing conditions"` / `"Icing conditions cleared"` — note the wording differs slightly from
the generic tracker's onset phrase). `IAircraftDefinition.HasOwnIcingAnnouncer` (default
`false` on `BaseAircraftDefinition`, overridden `true` on `FlyByWireA380Definition`) lets the
generic announcer detect this and skip itself **entirely** for that aircraft —
`AnnounceAmbientChanges` gates the whole `STRUCTURAL ICE PCT` branch on
`currentAircraft?.HasOwnIcingAnnouncer != true`, not merely muted — so one icing episode on the
A380 is never spoken by two voices, the same one-condition-one-call-out rule as the documented
PB-light/ECAM-memo invariant (see [A380-21] in [invariants/a380-panels.md](invariants/a380-panels.md)). The A380's own announcer is
deliberately **not** gated on the new `AnnounceIcingEnabled` setting — it predates the setting
and is aircraft-curated; turning the new toggle off silences the generic tracker for every
other aircraft but leaves the A380's own voice untouched. (Making the A380 announcer also
respect the toggle is a recorded one-line follow-up, not done here.)

**(d) Settings.** Two new `UserSettings` bools (`Settings/UserSettings.cs`), both default
`true`: `AnnounceTurbulenceEnabled` and `AnnounceIcingEnabled`. Both live in the Weather
settings tab's Announcements group (`Forms/Settings/WeatherPanel.cs`), directly under the
master "Auto-announce weather state changes" checkbox, and both round-trip via
`LoadFrom`/`ApplyTo` unconditionally — hiding a checkbox never resets its stored value, the
same rule the announcement-interval combo already follows (§5).

Visibility is computed in `UpdateActiveSkyDependentVisibility`:

```csharp
bool master = _weatherAutoAnnounce.Checked;
_announceTurbulence.Visible = master && _activeSkyEnabled.Checked;
_announceIcing.Visible = master;
```

"Announce turbulence changes" needs **both** the master auto-announce switch and ActiveSky
enabled — the data source is AS-only, so the checkbox is meaningless (and hidden, out of the
NVDA tab order) without AS. "Announce icing" needs only the master switch — `STRUCTURAL ICE
PCT` is a stock SimVar with no ActiveSky dependency, so it stays reachable with AS off. Neither
checkbox appears at all with the master auto-announce switch off, matching every other
sub-toggle on this tab.

## 11. Weather Radar: ListBox conversion + live refresh (2026-07)

Design doc: `docs/design/2026-07-12-weather-radar-listbox-design.md`. This completes, for the
Weather Radar window (Shift+R, `Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`), the 2026-07-02 "Live-Display
Consistency Pass" that had already converted every other live text display in the app (E/WD,
OANS, RMP, HS787 display + EICAS, GSX menu, ECL, all MCDU/CDU/DCDU forms, MainForm's status
display — see `docs/a32nx.md`'s "single reconcile home" list). The radar's five multi-line
readouts — `_currentWeatherBox`, `_stationBox`, `_profileBox`, `_advisoriesBox`,
`_windsAloftBox` — are `DisplayListBox` rows reconciled through `DisplayList.UpdateInPlace`
(rewrites only the rows whose text changed, grows/shrinks the tail in place, never
`Items.Clear()`, restores the reading cursor by ROW CONTENT nearest the old index, no-ops on
unchanged content). Every write site is `_box.SetText(value)`, splitting on `\r\n`/`\n` with
`StringSplitOptions.None` so blank separator rows and `─`-rule rows survive as their own items —
one fact/advisory/wind level per row, exactly as `UpdateInPlace`'s duplicate-row matching
already assumes elsewhere. The text-building code itself (`FormatAmbientFromActiveSky`,
`BuildProfileNarrative`, `BuildWindsAloftText`, the advisories builder) is byte-identical; only
the sink changed.

The window now auto-refreshes every **30 seconds** via a `System.Windows.Forms.Timer`
(`_autoRefreshTimer`), calling `RefreshAsync(forceRefresh: false)` — the same call the pass's
other pop-outs use. `forceRefresh: false` lets the internet-backed fetches (SIGMET/PIREP
advisories, Open-Meteo winds aloft) keep serving from their existing TTL caches; the cheap
AS/SimConnect fetches (ambient, station, profile, AS winds, mode line, position) re-run every
tick, so the boxes track the flight without the pilot ever touching F5. This is safe specifically
*because* the readouts are `DisplayListBox` rows: an unchanged tick reconciles to a no-op, and a
changed one updates in place without moving the reading cursor — the TextBox form of this window
could never have auto-refreshed without resetting the NVDA position on every tick. F5 and the
Refresh button still pass `forceRefresh: true` for an immediate, uncached pull.

`_autoRefreshTimer` carries the same `IsDisposed` guards as `FlyByWireDcduForm`'s poll timer
(the precedent recorded in `docs/a32nx.md` §"2026-06-12 bug-pass hardening"): the timer is
created and started only `if (!IsDisposed)` after the initial `RefreshAsync(forceRefresh: true)`
await returns (the form can be closed while that first fetch is in flight), and its `Tick`
handler re-checks `IsDisposed` before firing another refresh. Skipping the creation/`Start()`
guard reproduces the DCDU's zombie-timer bug — starting a disposed WinForms timer silently
re-creates its native timer with no cleanup path ever stopping it; the Tick-body guard is
belt-and-braces against one late queued tick. `OnFormClosed` and `Dispose(bool)`
both stop and null the timer, belt-and-braces (the radar closes fully rather than hiding — the
hide-on-close pattern belongs to the A380 RMP, not here — and the guard shape is identical to
the DCDU's).

The single-line `_asModeBox` (ActiveSky mode status) is deliberately **not** part of this
conversion — it stays the read-only TextBox from the 2026-07-11 keyboard-reachability fix (§9a):
a one-line list adds nothing, and that box already has its own carve-out from the original
consistency pass.

The form's own fetch-status readout got the same keyboard-reachability fix, one review pass
later (2026-07-13): `_statusLabel` (a `Label`) became `_statusBox`, a read-only `TextBox` at
`TabIndex 10` — this is the ONLY surface for a fetch's error text and the "Last updated"
freshness stamp, including errors raised by the unattended 30 s auto-refresh tick, and a Label
would have made both unreachable by keyboard exactly like the mode box before it. `SetStatus`
writes it through `DisplayText.SetPreserveCaret` rather than a raw `Text =` assignment too, for
the same caret-preservation reason as the mode box (§9a).

**The Refresh button is deliberately never disabled**, even mid-fetch: `RefreshAsync` used to
set `_refreshButton.Enabled = false` for the duration of a fetch, but WinForms moves focus off a
disabled control automatically — with a 30 s timer now running unconditionally, that would steal
focus from a user resting on the Refresh button every single tick. The `Enabled` toggle (both
the disable and the `finally` re-enable) was removed entirely; the pre-existing `_isFetching`
guard already makes a mid-fetch click or tick a harmless no-op. That no-op is now a REPLAY, not
a drop (2026-07-13 fix): a manual F5 that lands while the 30 s timer's own `RefreshAsync` is
already in flight sets `_pendingForceRefresh |= forceRefresh` instead of returning silently, and
the `finally` block that clears `_isFetching` fires one forced pass
(`RefreshAsync(forceRefresh: true)`) if that flag is set — so a pilot who presses Refresh mid-tick
still gets one guaranteed uncached pull, it just lands right after the in-flight tick finishes
instead of being silently absorbed by it.

## 12. En-route advisories (ActiveSky route SIGMETs/AIRMETs) (2026-07)

Design doc: `docs/design/2026-07-12-route-advisories-design.md`. A read-only Weather Radar
addition plus a background announcer, both riding `ActiveSkyClient.GetRouteAdvisoriesTextAsync()`
— a parameterless `GET /GetActiveSigmetsAt` that answers for whatever flight plan is currently
**loaded in ActiveSky itself**, not for the aircraft's proximity like the existing SIGMET/AIRMET
box (the Nearby Advisories box, which stays position+range and aviationweather.gov-sourced —
§13 records that decision and its live-probe evidence).

**(a) Route source and the API-only constraint.** The 2026-07-10 audit had assumed this needed
MSFSBA to export a `.pln` and push it via `LoadFlightPlan`. Live verification on 2026-07-12
(OMDB→LTFM en route at FL358) proved that unnecessary for SimBrief-linked setups: ActiveSky's
own SimBrief downloader already satisfies AS's "loaded flight plan" requirement, so the bare
parameterless call answered authoritatively for the current route (`"No airmet/sigmet affecting
currently loaded flight plan route"`). MSFSBA pushes no plan and reads no file — the route is
whatever AS itself has loaded, kept current by AS's own SimBrief link (or by the user loading a
plan in AS directly). This is Robin's explicit constraint, not just a simplification: no `.pln`
export, and no reading `activeflightplanwx.txt` or any other file under `%APPDATA%\HiFi\` (a
custom AS install path would silently break a file-based read, and §8 already forbids scanning
that tree for other reasons) — everything comes from the HTTP API, same as every other AS
surface in this doc. `LoadFlightPlan` push remains a possible future fallback for non-SimBrief
users; it is out of scope here (design doc §10).

**(b) The parser is deliberately defensive.** `ActiveSkyFormatting.ParseRouteAdvisories`
(`Services/ActiveSkyFormatting.cs`) is pure and CI-tested. A response beginning with
`"No airmet/sigmet"` (case-insensitive) — the only no-hit shape actually observed during the
2026-07-12 audit — parses to an empty list.

The hit format is now KNOWN (live capture 2026-07-12): each advisory is exactly three
lines — header (`MHTG SIGMET J5 EMBD TS`), `Valid until: 2200z`, and the raw SIGMET
body — separated by single CRLF with NO blank lines, and ActiveSky repeats the same
advisory once per route-segment intersection (the capture carried the identical MHTG
J5 block seven times). `ParseRouteAdvisories` therefore splits on header lines
(`^\S{3,4}\s+(SIGMET|AIRMET)\s+\S+`, case-insensitive) and DEDUPLICATES by key
(first line, case-insensitive, first-seen order) into one `RouteAdvisory { Key, Lines }` per
distinct advisory. The defensive fallbacks remain: truly-blank lines still split,
unrecognized text still renders verbatim as its own block (with its own first line standing
in as the key), and the "No airmet/sigmet" sentence still parses to an empty list — so the
parser never drops or throws on anything it doesn't recognize, one readable, self-explanatory
row rather than silence or a crash.

Each parsed `RouteAdvisory` also carries decoded fields (`Identity`, `Hazard`, `ObsFcst`,
`VerticalExtent`, `Movement`, `Trend`, `ValidUntil`), extracted from `Lines` by pure regexes;
the `WI` lat/lon polygon is deliberately never extracted (see (c)). `ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildRouteAdvisoriesText`
is the matching renderer for the radar box (see (c)); the tracker in (d) works from the same
`Key` list.

**(c) Weather Radar box.** A new `"Route Advisories (ActiveSky):"` label + `_routeAdvisoriesBox`
(`DisplayListBox`) sits between Vertical Profile and Nearby Advisories in `WeatherRadarForm`
(`Forms/WeatherRadarForm.cs`), fetched by `FetchRouteAdvisoriesAsync` inside `RefreshAsync`'s
parallel batch — four-way before this feature, five-way with this addition — so it rides the
form's 30 s auto-refresh (§11) with no new poll loop. Three fetch outcomes (plus the visibility
rule), matching every other AS-only surface in this doc:

- Advisories present, decode checkbox off → each deduplicated block's lines as rows, one blank
  row between blocks (raw AS text, unmodified).
- Advisories present, decode checkbox on → each advisory renders instead as its rebuilt
  plain-English summary (see **Decode gating** below).
- No hit → `BuildRouteAdvisoriesText` renders the single sentence `"No advisories on route."`
  (never the raw AS wording, and never silence — a clear route is itself a fact worth reading).
- AS enabled but the fetch failed (`GetRouteAdvisoriesTextAsync` returned `null`) →
  `FetchRouteAdvisoriesAsync` returns `"unavailable"`.
- AS switch off → the label and box are hidden entirely (`_routeAdvisoriesLabel.Visible =
  _routeAdvisoriesBox.Visible = asEnabled`, evaluated every refresh), out of the NVDA tab order,
  matching the mode line/station/profile boxes rather than showing disabled placeholder text.

**Decode gating.** The box follows the same "Decode advisories into plain English"
checkbox (`UserSettings.DecodeWeatherAdvisories`) as the Nearby Advisories box:
unchecked shows the raw blocks (split + deduplicated); checked shows a rebuilt
plain-English summary per advisory ("MHTG SIGMET J5: Central American FIR, embedded
thunderstorms, observed at 1830Z, tops FL520, moving west at 5 knots, no change
expected." / "Valid until 2200Z.") built from the decoded fields — FIR name (the body's
leading "<code> <NAME> FIR" declaration, title-cased: the geographic name is what a
blind pilot can use, the MHCC/NZZO code is not — Robin's 2026-07-13 feedback), hazard,
observed/forecast time, vertical extent, movement, trend. The `WI` lat/lon polygon is
deliberately dropped from the
decoded view (noise when read aloud; flip the checkbox off to see it). The summary path
requires a decoded HAZARD (`HasDecodedContent`): a block whose phenomenon is out of
vocabulary renders verbatim even with decoding on, no matter how many other fields decoded
— a summary must never drop what the SIGMET is FOR. Decoding never hides data.

**(d) Announce lifecycle — proximity events, not key-novelty (2026-07-14 redesign).** Design doc:
`docs/design/2026-07-14-route-advisory-proximity-design.md`. `MainForm.WeatherAnnouncementTimer_Tick`
calls `CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync` (`MainForm.Announcers.cs`) on the same 30 s tick as the SIGMET/PIREP
proximity check, guarded by its own reentrancy flag (`_routeAdvisoryCheckRunning`, the
`_proximityCheckRunning` pattern) and gated on `AnnounceRouteAdvisoriesEnabled`. The central AS gate
inside `IsRunningAsync()` (§1) makes the check free for non-AS users despite riding the tick
unconditionally.

**Why key-novelty was replaced.** The original tracker (`Services/RouteAdvisoryTracker.cs`,
seen-set + a 15-minute `ClearAnnouncedKeys()` reminder mirroring `_announcedSigmetKeys`) re-announced
EVERY still-active advisory once the 15-minute window elapsed, including advisories already behind
the aircraft — and US convective SIGMETs are re-issued hourly under a new identifier for what is
geometrically the same cell (live-observed: `CONVECTIVE SIGMET 68E` → `78E`), so the seen-set treated
each re-issue as a brand-new key and announced it on sight, regardless of position. Net effect Robin
reported: whenever the advisory list changed, everything re-announced, including areas already
behind. `RouteAdvisoryTracker.cs` and its seen-set/`ClearAnnouncedKeys` reminder, and the old
`RouteAdvisoriesTests` coverage of it, are DELETED — replaced end to end by
`Services/RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker.cs` (field `_routeAdvisoryProximity` in `MainForm.cs`), a
pure per-key proximity zone state machine pinned by `RouteAdvisoryProximityTrackerTests.cs`.

**Zone table.** Each advisory key (OrdinalIgnoreCase) sits in one of four zones, driven each tick
by the `LocationFact` computed for it (§12(g)):

| Zone | Meaning | Reached from | Leaves to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unplaced | no geometry resolved for this key (no WI polygon, no tier-2 match) | first sight with no geometry | Inside only, via a later positional probe match — see below |
| Far | outside the approach ring | first sight, or Near receding past the re-arm threshold | Near, on advancing to ≤ ring |
| Near | within the ring, not inside | first sight, or Far advancing past the ring | Far (past the re-arm threshold) or Inside |
| Inside | positionally inside the area | first sight, or Near/Far entering | Near/Far, after 2 consecutive not-inside ticks |

**Constants and setting** (`RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker`). The approach ring is now a
per-call parameter, not a fixed constant — the distance made a setting the same day it was
designed, on Robin's request after seeing the settings tab (see the design doc's post-note).
`Observe(facts, approachNm)` takes the live ring (nm) on every call, so a mid-flight settings
change applies on the very next 30 s tick with no rewiring: `RouteAdvisoryProximityNm`
(`UserSettings`, default 100, Weather-tab-editable, clamped 10-500 by
`CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync` before it reaches the tracker) is read fresh every tick.
`DefaultApproachNm = 100` is the constant's old fixed value, kept as the property/tracker
default and as a named constant tests can reference. `RearmBandNm = 10` is a **fixed** 10 nm hysteresis band ABOVE
whatever ring is in effect (`rearmNm = approachNm + RearmBandNm`) — this is the tuned hysteresis
WIDTH, not a second knob, so a key sitting right at the ring can't flap Approach on and off tick
to tick even after the ring itself changes. `LeaveConfirmTicks = 2` (~1 minute at the 30 s
cadence) means a single tick's boundary graze — a polygon edge crossed back and forth by GPS
noise — cannot fire a spurious Leave, and the outside-tick counter resets to 0 the instant a tick
reports Inside again.

Because every transition is edge-based (dispatched off the CURRENT zone plus the CURRENT
distance/ring, never a remembered "old ring"), a threshold change mid-flight behaves sanely
with no special-casing: shrinking the ring lets an already-Near key re-arm silently the instant
it sits outside the new (ring + band) boundary (a `Near→Far` transition, which is always silent
regardless of why the boundary moved); growing the ring fires Approach on the very next tick for
any key now genuinely inside it — from the tracker's point of view that key just entered the
ring, whether the aircraft moved or the ring did.
`RouteAdvisoryProximityTrackerTests.Custom_ring_is_respected`,
`Rearm_band_rides_the_configured_ring`, and `Shrinking_the_ring_mid_flight_rearms_silently`
pin this.

`RouteAdvisoryProximityNm` is **deliberately independent of `SigmetProximityRangeNm`** (the
nearby-SIGMET/AIRMET/PIREP proximity-alert range, §13) — they are separate settings on separate
features (route-advisory zone events vs. aviationweather.gov position+range queries) that happen
to share the same UI shape (a 10-500 nm `NumericUpDown`); tuning one must never silently move
the other.

**Events and wording** (`ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildProximityAnnouncement`):

- **Approach** — first sight within the configured ring (default 100 nm), or a Far→Near
  crossing, while the area is NOT behind
  the aircraft: `"Route advisory, {n} nautical miles ahead: {core}."` A Near crossing (or first
  sight) that IS behind the aircraft is silent and latches Approach off for that key.
  **Behind-suppression is Approach-ONLY** — it never applies to Enter or Leave, so a behind-latched
  area the aircraft is later routed through still Enters normally.
- **AtPosition** — first sight already inside: `"Route advisory at your position: {core}."`
- **Enter** — a Far/Near→Inside transition observed on a LATER tick (never at first sight — a key
  seen already-inside on its first tick is AtPosition, not Enter), REGARDLESS of bearing; this
  includes re-entry after a full Leave: `"Entering advisory area: {core}."`
- **Leave** — 2 consecutive not-inside ticks after Inside: `"Left advisory area:
  {identity-or-key}."` — deliberately brief (identity or raw key only, no full decode): a Leave is
  an interruption, not a re-briefing.
- **AnnounceOnce** — a no-geometry key at first sight: `"Route advisory: {core}."` (unchanged
  wording from the pre-2026-07-14 tracker).

**Once Inside, Approach is latched off forever.** A key that has ever been Inside never fires
Approach again — not even after a full Leave → Far → re-Near cycle; only Enter/Leave stay live for
it. Re-entry is still a real event and still announces (Enter); a second "getting close" warning
for ground already covered once is not. This latch is set on **all five** code paths that reach
Inside — three on an already-zoned key (new key first-sight inside via geometry, an existing
zoned key crossing in via geometry, and the geometry-hiccup `Enter` where a zoned key momentarily
lost geometry but the probe still confirms Inside) AND two no-geometry paths (a first-sight
`AtPosition` with no geometry at all, and an `Unplaced` key's later probe-driven `Enter`). The two
no-geometry paths were a review-found hole (a key
that went Inside with no geometry could re-announce Approach once geometry later appeared, receded
past 110 nm, and re-approached) — fixed in commit `3e8e3a12`, pinned by two regression tests,
`After_probe_at_position_inside_approach_never_fires_when_geometry_appears` and
`After_probe_enter_inside_approach_never_fires_when_geometry_appears`.

**No-geometry keys: announce-once, probe-Enter, and probe-match LOSS ALONE never Leaves.** A key
with neither a WI polygon (tier 1) nor a tier-2 aviationweather.gov match (§12(g)) tracks in the
distance-less `Unplaced` zone. Its only live transition while it stays `Unplaced` is the positional
probe: if the probe later matches the key (`Inside` becomes true), **Enter** fires once and the key
leaves `Unplaced` behind, becoming a normally-zoned `Inside` key. Because probe-match loss is not
"outside" (§12(g)'s probe-strengthens-only rule), losing the probe match BY ITSELF can never produce
Leave for a key that stays no-geometry forever — it stays silently Inside. **This is narrower than
"never Leave" overall, though:** once real (tier-1 or tier-2) geometry subsequently appears for that
same now-`Inside` key, geometry becomes authoritative for it exactly like any other zoned key, and a
later confirmed-outside reading (`LeaveConfirmTicks`) fires Leave normally — the "never Leave" rule
covers only the probe-match signal in isolation, not a key whose geometry later resolves. Pinned by
the two regression tests `After_probe_at_position_inside_approach_never_fires_when_geometry_appears`
and `After_probe_enter_inside_approach_never_fires_when_geometry_appears` (both drive a probe-Entered
key through a later-appearing geometry fact all the way to a genuine Leave).
**Recorded follow-up (not fixed here):** an `Unplaced` key that never goes Inside stays `Unplaced`
for its whole life even if tier-2 geometry becomes available for it on a LATER tick (e.g. the
tier-2 feed happened to be down on the exact tick the key was first observed, then recovered) — it
never gains normal Far/Near/Inside zoning while it keeps missing both the probe and geometry, only
the no-geometry rules above. (This is a separate limitation from the paragraph above — a key that
DOES go Inside, whether via the probe or real geometry, is no longer `Unplaced` and is not subject
to it.) This is a rare tier-2-outage-at-first-sight case, not the common path. A future upgrade
could let a still-outside `Unplaced` key adopt geometry the first time it becomes available and
re-zone from there; the design would need to guard against double-announcing Approach for a key
already Inside-latched via the no-geometry path.

**Silent expiry — deliberate.** A key absent from the current fact set (its SIGMET expired, or was
replaced by a re-issued identifier) is pruned with NO event, even if it was Inside. This is the
second half of the churn fix: announcing expiry would resurrect the exact double-announce the
redesign exists to kill (old number's expiry + new number's first-sight both speaking) — the
Shift+R box shows current advisories; the spoken channel does not narrate expiry.

**The frozen-tick contract.** `RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker.Observe` may be called ONLY with a
fact set that exactly covers every current advisory — `CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync` enforces this
with `if (facts.Count != advisories.Count) return;` immediately before calling `Observe`. This
matters because `Observe`'s prune rule treats ANY tracked key missing from the fact dictionary as
expired (see Silent expiry above); a partial fact set — from an unusable aircraft position or a
mid-loop failure inside `ComputeFactsAsync` — would otherwise be indistinguishable from "these keys
expired," silently losing live zone/latch state and re-announcing those keys as first-sight next
tick. So the caller freezes the tick outright (does not call `Observe` at all) whenever the counts
don't match — including a failed fetch (`raw == null`, returns before `advisories` or `facts` are
even computed) and an unusable/unknown aircraft position (`simConnectManager.LastKnownPosition`
null leaves `facts` at its empty default, which only equals `advisories.Count` when there are no
advisories to place). A genuinely empty feed — `advisories.Count == 0`, hence `ComputeFactsAsync`
correctly returns an empty dictionary with no I/O — is the one valid EMPTY call, and correctly
prunes every tracked key.

**Reset.** `_routeAdvisoryProximity.Reset()` is called from the same two sites the old tracker's
`Reset()` was — `MainForm.AircraftSwitch.cs`'s `OnConnectionStatusChanged` "Connected" branch
(alongside `_announcedSigmetKeys.Clear()`) and `SwitchAircraft` (alongside the other hazard
trackers' resets — turbulence, icing) — forgetting every key's zone/latches so a reconnect or
aircraft swap re-baselines from first sight.

**Third reset trigger — turnaround liftoff (2026-07-14, Robin's turnaround question).**
`Services/TurnaroundLiftoffDetector.cs` (field `_turnaroundDetector` in `MainForm.cs`) watches the
`SIM_ON_GROUND` edges alongside the cache in `MainForm.Announcers.cs` and reports a "turnaround
liftoff" — a touchdown edge followed by at least 5 minutes on the ground, then a liftoff edge — at
which point `_routeAdvisoryProximity.Reset()` (and `_emptyRouteFeedTicks = 0`) fire a third time.
Rationale: an advisory key can survive a same-session turnaround unchanged in the ActiveSky feed
(same SIGMET number, still on the loaded route), so without this reset flight 1's `EverInside`
latch would silently suppress flight 2's configured-ring Approach call for that same key. Touch-and-goes and
oleo-bounce flickers (dwell &lt; 5 min) never fire it, and the session's first departure never fires
it either (arming requires an observed touchdown first). The detector is reset alongside the tracker
at both reset sites above, so a stale touchdown stamp from before a reconnect/aircraft-switch can
never fire a bonus reset later.

**Route advisories no longer share the SIGMET/PIREP reminder cadence.** The nearby-SIGMET/PIREP
proximity alerts (§13) still clear their seen-set every 15 minutes (`_announcedSigmetKeys` /
`_sigmetKeysClearedAt`) — that cadence is correct THERE because those alerts are already
proximity-filtered (an aviationweather.gov position+range query) before a key is even generated, so
a 15-minute re-announce is a legitimate "still nearby" reminder. Route advisories were never
proximity-filtered before keying — ActiveSky's route endpoint returns everything on the loaded
route regardless of aircraft position — which is exactly why the same reminder shape produced churn
here instead. There is no route-advisory equivalent of `ClearAnnouncedKeys()` any more: the
Approach/Enter/Leave zone events ARE the reminder mechanism now, tied to real proximity, not a
clock.

**(e) Settings.** `UserSettings.AnnounceRouteAdvisoriesEnabled` (bool, default `true`; `Clone()` is
a serializer round-trip since PR #189 and needs no per-property edit) backs a new checkbox in the
Weather panel's Announcements group,
`"Announce route advisories by proximity (ActiveSky)"` (caption updated 2026-07-14 alongside the
proximity-event redesign in §12 above — the old text/AccessibleName described the superseded
key-novelty semantics), placed with the SIGMET/PIREP proximity rows
(`Forms/Settings/WeatherPanel.cs`). Like those two siblings it is a proximity-alert-style
sub-toggle **independent of the "Auto-announce weather state changes" master** — unlike them
(and unlike the turbulence/icing toggles in §10d, which need the master), its visibility is
gated on ActiveSky alone: `_routeAdvisoryAlerts.Visible = _activeSkyEnabled.Checked` in
`UpdateActiveSkyDependentVisibility`, because the data source is AS-only and the checkbox is
meaningless without it. Hiding never resets the stored value; `LoadFrom`/`ApplyTo` round-trip it
unconditionally either way.

**Approach-ring distance is a setting (2026-07-14, same-day revision).** The design doc's §0
decision — "The 100 nm threshold is a fixed constant (no setting)" — was revised the same day at
Robin's request after seeing the settings tab: `UserSettings.RouteAdvisoryProximityNm` (int,
default `100`; `Clone()` is a serializer round-trip since PR #189 and needs no per-property edit)
is a new "En-route advisory distance (nautical
miles)" `NumericUpDown` row placed directly below the existing SIGMET/PIREP "Proximity range"
row, `Min/Max = 10/500` matching that sibling control. It is **route-advisory-only**, so its
Label + `NumericUpDown` are gated exactly like the `_routeAdvisoryAlerts` checkbox itself
(`_routeAdvisoryDistanceLabel/_routeAdvisoryDistance.Visible = _activeSkyEnabled.Checked`) — not
a new gating mechanism, the same one joined. `CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync` reads
`Math.Clamp(SettingsManager.Current.RouteAdvisoryProximityNm, 10, 500)` fresh every 30 s tick and
passes it straight into `RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker.Observe(facts, approachNm)` — the clamp
exists because the UI already enforces 10-500, but a hand-edited settings JSON must not hand the
tracker a 0/negative or absurd ring. Because the ring is a per-call parameter rather than a
tracker field, a mid-flight settings change takes effect on the very next tick with no
reconnect/restart and no explicit rewiring — see the Constants-and-setting paragraph above for
how shrinking/growing the ring behaves against live zone state. **Deliberately independent of
`SigmetProximityRangeNm`** — they are two settings for two different features that happen to
share the same UI shape; tuning one must never silently move the other. A missing key in an
older settings JSON deserializes to the property initializer's default, 100, same as any other
`UserSettings` property. `RouteAdvisoryDistance_roundtrips_independently_of_sigmet_range`,
`RouteAdvisoryDistance_defaults_to_100`,
`RouteAdvisoryDistance_needs_activesky_only_same_as_its_checkbox`, and
`HiddenRouteAdvisoryDistance_StillRoundTripsItsValue` in `WeatherPanelTests.cs` pin this.

**(f) Honest verification caveat.** The no-hit path, the box's three-way rendering, the 30 s
refresh, and the settings toggle are all verifiable on demand and were exercised during
development. The HIT path — a real SIGMET/AIRMET response, its parsing, and its decoding — is
now live-verified: the 2026-07-12 live capture (live MHTG SIGMET J5 and YMMM T07 advisories,
the former repeated seven times across route-segment intersections) is pinned as the test
fixture in `RouteAdvisoriesTests.cs`, and the full suite is green against it — dedup,
decoded-field extraction, box rendering with decoding on and off, and the announcement builder
all exercise the real captured text, not a hand-written approximation. The capture came from a
KMIA→YSSY (Miami→Sydney) plan Robin dispatched deliberately to cross many FIRs, which is why the
response carries both a Central-American-FIR SIGMET (MHTG) and a Melbourne-FIR SIGMET (YMMM) —
the route-filtered framing is confirmed, since both FIRs genuinely lie along that great-circle
route. A second live capture (2026-07-13, KMIA→KJFK) confirmed the ROUTE endpoint also serves
US convective advisories in the same shape — CONVECTIVE SIGMET 54E repeated 5× across
route-segment intersections, deduped to one — and added the wind-style movement group
("MOV FROM 27010KT" → "moving from 270 degrees at 10 knots") to the decoder's vocabulary;
that capture is pinned in `RouteAdvisoriesTests.cs` too.

The last remaining path — a genuinely NEW advisory appearing after the tracker's baseline and
firing `"Route advisory: …"` live — was verified on 2026-07-13: with the app running and the
announce toggle on, Robin loaded a new KMIA→KJFK plan into ActiveSky mid-session, the next tick
picked up CONVECTIVE SIGMET 54E as a new key, and the announcement was heard exactly once, with
no startup burst. The feature is now live-verified end to end: parser and decoder against two
real captures (2026-07-12 ICAO, 2026-07-13 US convective), and the baseline/new-key announce
path against a real mid-session route change.

**(g) Location context (2026-07, amended 2026-07-14).** Design docs:
`docs/design/2026-07-13-route-advisory-location-design.md` and, for the edge-distance +
facts/proximity amendments below, `docs/design/2026-07-14-route-advisory-proximity-design.md` §3-4.
On top of the advisory list above, every route advisory gains a derived, position-relative fact —
how far the aircraft is from the advisory area, and whether that area is ahead, behind, or the
aircraft is inside it — computed purely from the aircraft's own SimConnect position. The feature
is strictly ADDITIVE: nothing that already renders changes, and an advisory that MSFSBA can't
resolve geometry for renders exactly as it did before this feature existed. As of 2026-07-14 this
location fact is also what feeds §12(d)'s proximity zone tracker — the box, the spoken Approach/
AtPosition suffix, and the zone tracker's own distance/inside checks all read the identical
`LocationFact` for a key, never three separate computations.

**Output contract (design §3, box wording amended §6).** Both the box and the spoken announcement
carry the SAME fact in two renderings, both produced by the pure `ActiveSkyFormatting.
BuildLocationPhrase(double? distanceNm, bool inside, bool behind, bool spoken)`:

- **Box** (`BuildRouteAdvisoriesText`'s optional `locations` parameter, honored in BOTH the raw and
  the decoded render mode): a trailing `Location: {phrase}` line appended as each block's FINAL
  line — `Location: 123 nm ahead`, `Location: 95 nm behind` (2026-07-14: dropped "you" — Robin's
  call, a listbox row reads faster terse than as a full sentence), `Location: less than one
  nautical mile ahead` (a distance that rounds to 0 nm — i.e. under 0.5 nm while still outside the
  polygon — renders this wording, never "0 nm"), `Location: Inside` (2026-07-14: was "at your
  position (inside the area)"). The SPOKEN forms are unchanged by this — see below — only the box's
  two terse forms moved; ahead wording is untouched on both sides. An advisory whose key is missing
  from `locations` gets no line at all.
- **Spoken** (`BuildRouteAdvisoryAnnouncement(RouteAdvisory a, string? locationPhrase = null)`):
  the same fact appended, comma-joined, after the existing decoded fields —
  `"…, 123 nautical miles ahead."` / `"…, at your position."` / `"…, 95 nautical miles behind
  you."` — no parenthetical and no "nm" abbreviation, and the unit is deliberately SINGULAR at
  exactly one (`"1 nautical mile ahead"`, never "1 nautical miles"); `locationPhrase == null`
  appends nothing, matching the box's missing-key behavior.
- Distance rounds with explicit `MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` (never .NET's default banker's
  rounding) and formats with invariant `"N0"`, so both renderings pick up a thousands separator
  on a four-digit distance — `"1,234 nm ahead"` in the box, `"1,234 nautical miles ahead"` spoken.
  This exact rounding/singular/separator behavior is a post-review fix (commit `328b6eec`), not
  in the original design text — read the code, not the plan, for the precise wording.

**Facts-core / phrase-wrapper split (2026-07-14, design §4).** `RouteAdvisoryLocator.
ComputeFactsAsync` (`Services/RouteAdvisoryLocator.cs`) is now the actual core — it does the one
positional probe plus all per-advisory geometry work and returns a `Dictionary<string,
LocationFact>` (`LocationFact { bool HasGeometry, bool Inside, double? DistanceNm, bool Behind }`),
ONE fact per advisory key, including no-geometry keys (so a caller can tell "no facts computed this
tick" apart from "computed, nothing to say"). `ComputeLocationsAsync` — the box's call site — is now
a THIN wrapper: it calls `ComputeFactsAsync` and maps each fact through the pure `ComposePhrase`
(box/spoken phrase for one fact; `null` = no line) via `RouteAdvisoryLocator.ComposePhrase`. The
announcer (`MainForm.CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync`, §12(d)) calls `ComputeFactsAsync` DIRECTLY — it
needs the raw facts to feed `RouteAdvisoryProximityTracker.Observe`, not phrases; the box needs only
phrases. Same underlying computation, two thin consumers, so the box and the zone tracker can never
observe a different fact for the same key on the same tick. Per computation pass `ComputeFactsAsync`
fires exactly ONE `ActiveSkyClient.GetPositionalAdvisoriesTextAsync(lat, lon)` probe — the
positional sibling of the route call in §12(a), same gate/port/timeout/null-on-error contract,
invariant-culture lat/lon — at the aircraft's own position, then resolves each advisory's geometry:

- **Tier 1 — the advisory's own `WI` polygon** (ICAO-style bodies): `AdvisoryGeometry.
  ParseWiPolygon` extracts the `[NS]ddmm [EW]dddmm` vertex pairs following the `WI` token; fewer
  than 3 parsed vertices (or no `WI` token at all) → no tier-1 geometry. `WI … NM OF CENTRE`
  circle shapes and `ENTIRE FIR` bodies are out of scope for v1 — they fall through to tier 2, or
  render with no Location line, by design.
- **Tier 2 — aviationweather.gov cross-match** (US convective bodies, whose AS text has its
  location line stripped — §13): `ComputeFactsAsync` calls `WeatherService.
  RefreshAndGetSigmetFeedsAsync()` — which refreshes the SAME TTL-cached `airsigmet`/`isigmet`
  feeds the Nearby Advisories box already uses (no extra HTTP within the TTL window, same lock
  discipline) — and then `FindAdvisoryPolygonInGeoJson(geojson, identityPhrase)`, which finds the
  cached feature whose raw text contains the advisory's decoded `Identity` phrase at a WORD
  BOUNDARY (not a bare substring — a phrase that is a prefix of a longer identity in the same feed,
  e.g. "CONVECTIVE SIGMET 5E" vs. "…5E1", must not match) and returns its first polygon ring. A
  matched feature whose geometry is unusable — an unrecognized `type`, fewer than 3 vertices, or a
  malformed/EMPTY `coordinates` array — is SKIPPED per-feature, not terminal (2026-07-13 fix):
  `FindAdvisoryPolygonInGeoJson` wraps the per-feature geometry walk so a bad shape just moves on
  to the next candidate feature with the same identity match, instead of throwing out of the loop
  and failing the whole lookup for that advisory. `RefreshAndGetSigmetFeedsAsync` together with
  `FindAdvisoryPolygonInGeoJson` are now the ENTIRE tier-2 API, called from `ComputeFactsAsync`
  at most ONCE per computation pass — lazily, only when some advisory actually needs tier-2
  geometry — instead of once per advisory (final-review Fix 2). The standalone
  `WeatherService.TryGetAdvisoryPolygonAsync(identityPhrase)` thin per-call wrapper this tier
  originally routed through was dead code once the locator started calling the refresh
  directly, and was deleted on 2026-07-13 — there is no other tier-2 entry point, and no other
  caller to keep it alive for.
- **The positional probe is the authoritative inside-check**, independent of whether geometry
  resolved. Per the §13 bundling finding, `ComputeFactsAsync` treats ONLY the first advisory
  parsed from the probe response (`ParseRouteAdvisories(probeRaw)[0]`) as position-matched —
  bundled advisories after `---------------------- Hazard:` separators are unrelated, not
  additional hits. A probe match wins unconditionally over geometry: `inside = probeMatched ||
  AdvisoryGeometry.IsInside(vertices, …)` for a geometry key, and `LocationFact(false, probeMatched,
  null, false)` directly for a no-geometry key — so a route advisory whose own text carries no
  geometry at all can still render "at your position"/`Inside` purely from the probe. This is also
  the probe-strengthens-never-weakens rule §12(d) leans on: `ComposePhrase`/the zone tracker check
  `fact.Inside` (which folds in the probe) before geometry-derived distance, never the reverse — a
  probe match that goes away on a later tick does NOT flip `Inside` back to false (another
  overlapping advisory may simply have become the response's first block), so nothing downstream can
  mistake a lost probe match for "left the area."

**Pure/tested vs. thin/untested (design §9).** The math and parsing are pure and CI-pinned:
`AdvisoryGeometry` (`ParseWiPolygon`, `IsInside`, `NearestEdge`, `IsBehind` —
`AdvisoryGeometryTests.cs`), `ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildLocationPhrase` (all four wordings plus the
singular/rounding/separator cases and the 2026-07-14 box-wording pins),
`RouteAdvisoryLocator.ComposePhrase` (`RouteAdvisoryLocatorTests.cs` — inside-wins-over-distance,
no-geometry yields no line, no-geometry-but-probe-inside still reads Inside, outside uses
distance+behindness) and its `ComputeFactsAsync` zero-position guard
(`ComputeFactsAsync_zero_position_yields_empty`), and `WeatherService.FindAdvisoryPolygonInGeoJson`
(a trimmed real `airsigmet` fixture, the live 54E feature). The proximity zone tracker itself is
pure and exhaustively pinned — `RouteAdvisoryProximityTrackerTests.cs` asserts the FULL event list
of every `Observe` call against the §12(d) zone table, row by row (see §12(d)). What remains
deliberately NOT unit-tested is `ComputeFactsAsync`'s live HTTP/tier-2 orchestration itself and
`ActiveSkyClient.GetPositionalAdvisoriesTextAsync` — the thin HTTP shells this doc's testing
philosophy (§12(f), and the sim-facing-paths rule in CLAUDE.md [CORE-5]) reserves for the in-sim test plan,
matching every other AS network call in this doc.

**Approximations carried from design §5 (distance approximation superseded 2026-07-14).** Two
deliberate approximations, both already load-bearing choices rather than oversights:

- **Edge-true distance (locally projected), not spherical-geodesic** — `AdvisoryGeometry.
  NearestEdge` computes point-to-segment distance over EVERY polygon edge (not just its vertices),
  in a local equirectangular frame centred on the aircraft (1° lat = 60 nm, 1° lon = 60·cos(lat)
  nm) — adequate at advisory scales (a documented non-goal near poles/the antimeridian, same as
  `IsInside`'s ray-cast). This REPLACED the original nearest-vertex-everywhere design (2026-07-14,
  proximity design §3 amendment): convective outlook polygons have edges long enough that
  nearest-VERTEX distance is off by tens of nm, and since the configured approach ring (§12(d)) IS the
  distance, the trigger has to be edge-true — one number used for the trigger, the box `Location:`
  line, AND the spoken Approach suffix everywhere within route advisories, so they can never
  disagree with each other.
  **Recorded, accepted divergence from a DIFFERENT box:** the separate Nearby Advisories box (§13
  — a position+range aviationweather.gov query, unrelated to route advisories) has always used its
  OWN independent nearest-vertex scan in `WeatherService.ClosestPointGeometry` — a separate
  implementation that happens to share the same vertex-only approximation, not a shared call
  target. `AdvisoryGeometry` used to carry a distinct nearest-vertex helper of its own, but it had
  zero production callers even before this refactor (the Nearby box never called it — it always
  called `ClosestPointGeometry` directly), so it has now been deleted as dead code, along with its
  unit test; `ClosestPointGeometry` is unaffected. The two boxes can legitimately show a slightly
  different distance for the same advisory; this was a known tradeoff at design time, not a
  regression. The pre-existing MultiPolygon caveat still applies on top of it: tier-2
  (`FindAdvisoryPolygonInGeoJson`) only ever returns the FIRST polygon ring of a `MultiPolygon`
  feature, while the Nearby Advisories box scans every ring, so a rare multi-area advisory can
  diverge for that reason too — both are recorded follow-ups, not bugs to fix here.
- **True HEADING, not ground track, decides ahead/behind** — `IsBehind` compares the bearing to
  the nearest boundary point (the nearest EDGE point since 2026-07-14, formerly the nearest vertex)
  against the aircraft's TRUE heading (`pos.HeadingMagnetic + pos.MagneticVariation`, the
  codebase's existing convention), because heading is already on `AircraftPosition` and track is
  not. In a strong crab the two can differ by 10-20°, which flips the ahead/behind word only when
  the advisory sits nearly abeam — acceptable at advisory-level awareness.
- **Binary, strict `>90°`** — `IsBehind` returns true only when the absolute relative bearing
  exceeds 90°; there are no clock positions, by design (Robin asked for ahead/behind only, not a
  bearing readout).

**Degradation ladder (design §8) — additive-only end to end.** Every failure path yields "no
phrase," never an exception, and never withholds the advisory's own text:

1. No usable SimConnect position → the two call sites now degrade differently (2026-07-14). For
   the box (`WeatherRadarForm.FetchRouteAdvisoriesAsync`), simply no `Location:` lines — everything
   else renders exactly as it did before this feature existed. The null case is filtered at the
   CALL SITE (`is { } pos` pattern match feeds `ComputeLocationsAsync`); the `(0,0)` case is
   `ComputeFactsAsync`'s own first guard, returning the empty dictionary before any I/O. For the
   announcer (`MainForm.CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync`), the consequence is stronger: an unusable
   position means `ComputeFactsAsync` is never even called, `facts` stays empty, and (per §12(d)'s
   frozen-tick contract) the WHOLE proximity tick freezes for that pass — no announcement of any
   kind fires, and every key's zone/latch state is held untouched for the next tick, not just its
   location suffix.
2. The positional probe fails, times out, or AS is unreachable mid-pass → the probe simply
   contributes nothing; per-advisory geometry (tier 1 / tier 2) may still resolve independently,
   so distance/ahead-behind can still render without an "at your position"/`Inside` override.
3. No geometry AND no probe hit for a given advisory → that advisory alone gets no Location line
   or announce suffix; every other advisory in the same box/announcement batch is unaffected. (On
   the announcer side this is the no-geometry `Unplaced` zone, §12(d) — the advisory still
   announces once via `AnnounceOnce`, just with no distance/direction attached.)
4. The probe runs inside the SAME background tick that fires the announcement
   (`MainForm.Announcers.cs`'s `CheckRouteAdvisoriesAsync`), so a hung probe adds at most its
   bounded 5 s HTTP timeout (`GetPositionalAdvisoriesTextAsync`'s `CancellationTokenSource`)
   before the tick's facts are ready — against the 30 s tick cadence, imperceptible — and on ANY
   failure the pass still completes, just with weaker per-advisory facts. The true worst case per
   pass is the probe's 5 s PLUS at most one SIGMET-feed refresh (`WeatherService.
   RefreshAndGetSigmetFeedsAsync`'s shared `HttpClient`'s 15 s timeout) — never one refresh per
   advisory: `RouteAdvisoryLocator.ComputeFactsAsync` fetches the feeds lazily, at most ONCE
   per pass, only when some advisory actually needs tier-2 geometry (final-review Fix 2; a hung
   feed also doesn't stamp its cache time on failure, so a persistently-unreachable feed retries
   this same bounded timeout on every pass rather than backing off). The box
   (`WeatherRadarForm.FetchRouteAdvisoriesAsync`) is never blocked either; it rides the same
   30 s auto-refresh as the rest of §12(c) with no new poll loop.
5. `ParseWiPolygon` rejects malformed/short `WI` token sequences permissively — it returns `null`
   for that advisory and never throws, matching the parser's existing never-drop-never-crash
   philosophy from §12(b).
6. `ComputeFactsAsync` itself never throws out of the pass — any unexpected exception mid-loop is
   caught, logged (`Log.Debug("Services", …)`), and whatever facts were already computed are
   returned as-is. On the announcer side this typically yields a short fact set, which (§12(d))
   fails the `facts.Count != advisories.Count` check and freezes the tick rather than calling
   `Observe` with a partial dictionary — so an escaping exception degrades to "silent this tick,"
   never a crash and never a corrupted zone/latch state.

## 13. Nearby advisories stay aviationweather.gov-sourced (2026-07-13 decision)

The Weather Radar's **Nearby Advisories** box and the SIGMET/PIREP **proximity auto-announce**
(`WeatherService.GetNearbyAdvisoriesAsync` / `GetNearbyPirepsAsync` — aviationweather.gov
`isigmet`/`airsigmet`/`pirep` GeoJSON, position+range filtered) deliberately do NOT follow the
per-engine source rule (§3). This was investigated and decided against on 2026-07-13, with live
probes against a running ASFS (aircraft at KMIA, three real SIGMETs within 300 nm):

- **In Live mode the two sources carry identical content.** All three aviationweather.gov
  advisories (one KZWY/KZMA oceanic-FIR `FRQ TS` SIGMET + two US convective SIGMETs) hit on
  ActiveSky's positional `GetActiveSigmetsAt?lat=&lon=` when probed inside their polygons; the
  oceanic body text was verbatim-identical. So switching sources gains nothing for the Live-mode
  majority while LOSING precision: aviationweather.gov's structured geometry gives the announcer
  its exact "bearing 240 degrees, 85 nautical miles" phrasing, which AS cannot provide (below).
- **The divergence window is non-Live modes only** (historic/custom/SimTime) — handled by a
  cheap caveat instead of a source switch: `ActiveSkyFormatting.BuildNearbyAdvisoriesModeCaveat`
  (pure, CI-tested) appends "Note: nearby advisories are live real-world data; ActiveSky is in
  {mode}." under the box header whenever AS is enabled+reachable and its parsed mode doesn't
  start with "Live". Zero extra I/O — the mode text rides the liveness probe already. Unknown
  /unreadable mode → no caveat; unrecognized mode text passes through verbatim (FormatModeLine's
  never-hide philosophy).

**Live-probe facts recorded for any future AS-sourced-proximity design** (also in the
2026-07-12 route-advisories design doc §10; these answer that doc's open questions):

- `GetActiveSigmetsAt?lat=&lon=` is strict point-in-polygon **containment** — a probe 3 nm
  outside a convective SIGMET's boundary already returns the no-hit sentence. No tolerance, no
  radius parameter, no "list all within N nm" form. A proximity feature must probe PROJECTED
  points (ring/track sampling); sampling density fully determines detection resolution.
- The positional no-hit sentence is **"No airmet/sigmet active at the requested position"** —
  different wording from the route variant's, but the parser's `StartsWith("No airmet/sigmet")`
  check covers both.
- **US convective bodies come back with their geometry stripped** — AS consumes the
  "FROM 160SE CHS-…" location line, returning "AREA TS MOV LTL. TOPS ABV FL450. …" only. There
  is no position data to parse out of AS text for US advisories; polygon-parsing designs are
  dead for that class. ICAO-style bodies keep their `WI` polygons.
- **A hit can bundle unrelated advisories** after `---------------------- Hazard: XX` separators
  on one body line — the ECHO 5 probe returned the matched advisory plus a mid-Atlantic SIGMET
  and an Indonesian volcanic-ash SIGMET, neither containing the probe point. Any consumer must
  treat only the FIRST advisory of a hit as position-matched (our block parser keeps the bundle
  as one block whose leading text is the matched advisory, so hazard/extent decode correctly).
- **AS's "Valid until:" line is suspect** — all three hits said `1600z` against real validities
  of 1605Z/1655Z; it may be AS's own data-window time, not the advisory's validity.
- **AS renders identities differently** — "SIGA SIGMET E5 TS" for aviationweather.gov's
  "SIGMET ECHO 5" (KZWY/KZMA). `IdentityPattern` matches both shapes.
